# Who are the Chapel Hill Quakers?
The Chapel Hill Friends Meeting joyfully embraces the full spectrum of the Light Within, made visible through the participation of people of all beliefs, cultures, backgrounds, abilities, ethnicities, races, sexual orientations, and gender identities. Quakers, also known as members of the Religious Society of Friends, are a community of people who gather on Sunday mornings to worship in silent expectation to wait upon the spirit. We have no formal creed, no ritual, or liturgy. 

We believe that God is present in every person and the Light Within can lead us toward God's will. The Religious Society of Friends has a long history of spiritually-based activism. We are guided by communal testimonies of simplicity, peace, integrity, community, equality, and service. We believe that Truth is continuously revealed and that everyone may have a direct experience with God. Our lives speak our faith in action.

## Branches of Quakerism
There are multiple branches of Quakerism, such as evangelical, conservative, pastoral and liberal. The Chapel Hill Friends Meeting indentifies itself as liberal. Liberal Friends emphasize the authority of the Inward Light which guides each of us in our lives and is our direct and immediate experience of the Divine. 

Our Meeting is also unprogrammed. That means we have no minister and no set service - no sermon, doxology or choir. There is an old saying "that we have no laity, because we are all ministers."

# Can anyone visit a Quaker Meeting?
Yes, anyone is welcome to visit a Quaker meeting. Our meeting specifically encourages individuals to become part of the corporate experience of Quaker faith and practice. 

We believe that there is that of God in every person, and joyfully embrace the full spectrum of the Light Within, made visible through the participation of people of all beliefs, cultures, backgrounds, abilities, ethnicities, races, sexual orientations, and gender identities. Those attending unprogrammed Quaker meetings include Christians, Universalists, Jews, nontheists, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhist Quakers, pagans, and others.

# Where is the Chapel Hill Friends Meeting?
<small>insert embedded Google Maps</small>  
The Meetinghouse (what we call our place of worship) is located at 531 Raleigh Road, Chapel Hill NC 27514. It is located near the intersection with Country Club Drive near the UNC-CH campus. Raleigh Rd. is also Route 54. There is a UNC-CH visitors' parking lot east of the Meetinghouse that is available for free parking on Sunday mornings. There are some parking spaces adjacent to the Meeting house in our parking lot. We are a two minute walk from the Institute of Government and from the old Chapel Hill Cemetery. There is a bus stop just west of the Meeting house on South Road across from the Institute of Government.

# What is Meeting for Worship?
Meeting for Worship is the heart of our Quaker community. The Chapel Hill Friends Meeting is of the Quaker unprogrammed tradition, meaning that we gather in silence and "expectant waiting for divine guidance", without clergy or liturgy. Together we nurture a living silence, with quiet minds and open hearts, creating a space within ourselves for spiritual revelation.

# What should I expect during the worship hour?
When we enter the meeting room, we quietly take our seats on the benches. During the hour or so of worship, anyone who is moved by the Spirit may rise and speak. After an hour, a designated member of the Meeting closes worship with a handshake, which is then shared with all those gathered.

# What should I wear?
Casual, comfortable clothing is the norm at the Chapel Hill Friends Meeting. You'll see folks in shorts and tee shirts, dresses, and jeans, depending on their personal preferences and comfort.

# Where should I sit?
You may sit anywhere in the meeting room.

# Will I have to introduce myself?
At the close of worship, folks who are new to the meeting are invited to introduce themselves. No one is required to do so, however. This is an opportunity for the meeting to get to know you and to welcome you.

# Is there an offering?
No offering is taken during the worship service, and there is not an expectation that you will make an offering when you visit the meeting. Of course, the work of the meeting does require support of the Meeting community. There is a box in the foyer for donations with a list above that box describing specifically how Meeting funds are used.

# Can I bring my kids?
Absolutely! Children are an important part of our community. We offer care for babies and toddlers downstairs in the Meeting house during the weekly 11 AM Meeting for Worship. For children aged three through high school, we have a First Day School (FDS) program (First Day is a traditional Quaker term for Sunday). 

You might want to come a few minutes before 11 AM to talk to the greeter at the front door about how to find the right class for your child. Most children sit with their parents for the first 15 minutes of Meeting for Worship, and then leave together for their classes next door in the school house building. 

You are welcome to join them for First Day School on your first visit to our Meeting, so you can meet the teachers and see what the class is like, or if it makes your child more comfortable.

# How do things get done in the Meeting community?
A Quaker meeting is a local worshiping community. Most meetings have few paid workers; the Chapel Hill Friends Meeting employs a First Day School (Sunday School) Coordinator and a Child Care Provider. Quaker meetings follow the guidance of the Spirit in business as well as in worship. 

Quaker meetings function by the service of members on committees. These volunteers handle the routine work of the meeting and prepare business that comes to the entire group for Spirit-led decision making in the Monthly Meeting for Worship with Attention to Business. Everyone is welcome to participate in the work of the meeting. 

## In depth
The bulk of the work is done by committees according to the Meeting's needs and concerns. Different committees may care for the quality of worship, finances, peace and justice work, hospitality, religious education, nurturing members, and care of the building. 

Committees perform specific tasks, think through issues, and come up with recommendations to present to the full meeting for consideration and decision-making during a meeting for business, the monthly meeting where our corporate decisions are made. 

In place of a traditional pastor, the clerk of the meeting has the role of a servant leader. The clerk serves as the center of communication within the meeting, guides the conduct of business meetings, and serves as the contact person with regional Quaker bodies. 

# What do Quakers mean when they say...?
<small>this section has a lot of content that will need to be formatted more carefully (and more complicated-ly) than the rest</small>

# How can I get involved?
At Chapel Hill Friends Meeting, there are a multitude of options for those who wish to engage in our community beyond simply attending Meeting for Worship. Here are some possibilities: 
September through May, three Sundays per month, the Adult Religious Education committee sponsors forums at 9:45 AM on topics of community interest. [List of Forums]()

On the first Sunday of each month, there is a community potluck after Meeting for Worship. Come join us! 

Attendance at the monthly Meeting for Worship with Attention to Business is an excellent way to experience Quaker ministry in process. Generally held at 9:00 AM on the third Sunday of the month, the [Meeting Calendar](/calendar) will provide information about the dates of these important Meetings. 

There are about 16 committees in our Meeting community, that carry out the work of the Meeting. Nearly all of them are open to anyone with a like-minded interest. [List and description of committees.]()

Often in the spring, interest groups begin that allow community members to study together, work on a project, or socialize. Topics vary widely, as does the frequency and duration of the group. To be kept up-to-date on such opportunities, subscribe to the listserv by emailing [news@chapelhillfriends.org.]() _(Or through my nifty popover on the home page!)_

# Can I just talk to someone about Quakers?
