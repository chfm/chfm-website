      <p>The Ministry and Worship Committee offered Quakerism 101, in 2017, a series of four two-hour sessions focused on learning about living in the Religious Society of Friends. Topics covered included history, beliefs, worship, social witness, decision making and other traditions of Friends. All videos, PDFs, and links and suggested readings, used in these 4 sessions, are available online to support your journey in Quakerism. Click on the session link and you will be taken to these materials.</p>
