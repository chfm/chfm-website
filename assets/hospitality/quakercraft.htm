<h2>How to access QuakerCraft</h2>
<p>These instructions assume that you have already bought, downloaded, and installed 
  <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-java-edition">MineCraft: 
  Java Edition</a> and have a screenname that you have given to Finn, and that 
  he has told you that you have been added to the server.</p>
<p>I strongly recommend joining the <a href="https://discord.gg/F2Jf9MQ">discord 
  server</a> for further assistance, as Minecraft can be very confusing to start.</p>
<p>First off, find the minecraft launcher. The icon looks like this:</p>
<img src="images/minecraft1.png" width="48" height="43"> 
<p>In the launcher, select &quot;Minecraft: Java Edition&quot;, then the big green 
  &quot;Play&quot; in the bottom center</p>

<p>When minecraft boots and you see the main menu, select &quot;Minecraft Realms&quot;</p>

<p>QuakerCraft should be right there in the middle. Select it, and then select 
  &quot;Play.&quot;</p>
