<p>Fri, Aug 14: From Chris </p>
<p>This one came yesterday:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, I am interested in joining this Sunday for late worship to explore 
  the Chapel Hill Friends Meeting. Please advise. </p>
<p>Kate Koehler<br>

<p>Generally, they are a variation of that. This has become more common during 
  the COVID shutdown and I think this is more what you will see. Hospitality will 
  not need to answer questions like &#8220;how do Quaker marriages work?&#8221; 
  or &#8220;How do I set up a Quaker memorial service?&#8221; In those cases, 
  Hospitality will just respond and say &#8220;Thank you. We have received your 
  request and, since marriages or memorials are the responsibility of our Ministry 
  and Worship Committee, I have forwarded your request to them and they will respond 
  soon.&#8221; Since this is the generic email address for people who do not know 
  us, it can be anything but right now, it is most often &#8220;How can I join 
  a Meeting for Worship and see what it is like?&#8221; In any case where you 
  just don&#8217;t know what to do, you can ask me and I&#8217;ll make something 
  up or you can ask one of the other committee clerks. It is not usually complicated 
  and you will make as good a guess as anyone else.</p>

Fri, Aug 14: email from Jeff
<p>My understanding is that the Clerk of the Meeting or the clerk of the appropriate 
  committee can be expected to respond to an email to Friends@chapelhillfriends.org 
  for the following topics:<br>
  Marriage requests go to Care and Counsel. <br>
  Memorial service inquiries go to Care and Counsel.<br>
  Membership requests go to the Clerk of the Meeting. <br>
  Transfer requests go to the Clerk of the Meeting.</p>
<p>The other emails I have seen relate to the Zoom link, building rental (forwarded 
  to John Hite), requests for interviews or more information (Clerk responds), 
  and commercial solicitations that may be ignored. Questions about the Zoom link 
  have been most prevalent lately and can relate to Hospitality as you noted.</p>

Sat, Aug 15: Phone conversation with Jan 
<p>Example of questions sent to friends@chf.org:</p>
<p>1. how do I get in contact with someone in the meeting. (unless very sure, 
  don't give out contact linfo but contact person firste)<br>
  2. need place to stay (in the light?)<br>
  3. history of chfm (Lois Hobbes was a resource</p>

<p>Hi, my name is Culzean Kennedy and I&#8217;m a student leader for IMPACT Service 
  Breaks, an alternative breaks program at the University of Georgia. Our program 
  takes a group of 15-20 students on a week-long, service-learning, substance-free 
  trip during spring break. To make our trips financially accessible to students, 
  we try to find volunteer housing where we have access to bathroom and kitchen 
  facilities as well as floor space for sleeping. We&#8217;re currently looking 
  for volunteer housing during our trip to Chapel Hill, NC during the week of 
  Friday/Saturday, March 8th/9th - Saturday/Sunday, March 16th/17th. Is there 
  someone I could speak to regarding volunteer housing on the phone? If so, please 
  email me back with a number and name as soon as possible! Also, I know asking 
  about housing while a pandemic is occurring is questionable, but this is for 
  housing in the far future, and the answer doesn't have to be definite. We as 
  a program are watching the course of the pandemic across the U.S. and recently 
  made the executive decision to cancel our fall and winter break trips. Your 
  church is on the top of our list for possible housing sites, because it seems 
  extremely inclusive and aware of social justice issues (note: our specific trip 
  focus is women's health). Also, this church seems extremely accessible, as IMPACT 
  trips make it a priority to be as inclusive as possible for all our trip participants. 
  Thank you so much for your consideration! My number is 404-769-1799, and my 
  email is impact.chapelhillnc.sb@gmail.com </p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p> Culzean</p>

<p>Hi, Culzean &#8211;</p>
<p>This sounds like a very good program and I am forwarding your email to our 
  Hospitality Committee for consideration. As you mentioned, it is a very uncertain 
  time and we are currently operating in a very guarded environment. Our Meeting 
  House has been closed since March and even Friends do not go there without prior 
  communication because we don&#8217;t want to endanger our resident. We all hope 
  things will be better in the Spring buy obviously, no one knows. As an unprogrammed 
  Quaker Meeting, we do all of our work through our committees and I will ask 
  Hospitality to discuss this at an upcoming meeting and see what they recommend. 
  The Clerk of the Hospitality Committee, Buzz Borchardt, may contact you to get 
  further details. I hope your program finds a way to be successful during these 
  challenging times.</p>
<p>In Peace.</p>
<p>Chris<br>

<p>Hi Culzean,<br>
  Thanks for your email. Just to begin, one clarifying question: When you mention 
  floor space for sleeping, it sounds as though you might be hoping for a place 
  to accommodate all 15-20 students. Or, are you looking for individual housing, 
  each with bathroom and kitchen access? </p>
<p>Thanks, and regards,<br>
  Buzz (Borchardt) </p>
