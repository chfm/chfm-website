    sections. (There is also a Google Docs version of the document <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/14R77_61b1EWxrPI1oj5Tck8eeNQOlba9m6EZZnMRS8M/edit?ts=5d698e85">here</a> 
    if you want to modify it.)</li>
    <li >Use double-sided sticky tape to adhere colorful welcome square to blank 
      card front.</li>
    <li >Put diagonal parallel strips of washi tape for decorative effect on top 
      of welcome square.</li>
    <li >That's it! </li>
  </ul>
