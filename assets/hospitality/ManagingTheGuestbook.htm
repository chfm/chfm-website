  <strong>Dear-------, </strong><b><br>
  <strong>Greetings from the Chapel Hill Friends Meeting! We are so glad you joined 
  us recently for meeting for worship.</strong></b></p>
  
<p><strong>I've enclosed some information about the meeting and our practice to 
  give you more of an idea of what we're about. </strong><b> <strong>Please feel 
  free to reach out if you have any questions or would like to talk!</strong></b></p>
  <p><strong>I also want to let you know that we have a great potluck for all 
    on the first Sunday of each month at the rise of meeting (~12:00pm) and we'd 
    love to see you there!</strong><b><br>
    <strong>It's a fun way to get to know people, and for us to get to know you. 
    </strong></b></p>
  
<p><strong>Hope to see you again soon. </strong><b> <strong>Please feel free to

    (to the left of the door as you walk into the library from the foyer).</p>
  
<p> Ministry &amp;Worship prints #1 and orders #2 from Quaker Press. Contact M&amp;W 
  (for example, Jan Hutton) if we need more of any of the enclosures.</p>

    and Speech&quot; can be ordered) Quaker Press of Friends General Conference:

<h2><a name="how"></a>How to Make Cards</h2>
  <ul type=disc>
    
  <li >If you need more of the colorful welcome squares, use the <a href="WelomeText.pdf">'welcome' 
    document</a> to print onto 8.5&quot;x11&quot; colorful cardstock and cut into 
    sections. (There is also a Google Docs version of the document <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/14R77_61b1EWxrPI1oj5Tck8eeNQOlba9m6EZZnMRS8M/edit?ts=5d698e85">here</a> 
    if you want to modify it.)</li>
    <li >Use double-sided sticky tape to adhere colorful welcome square to blank 
      card front.</li>
    <li >Put diagonal parallel strips of washi tape for decorative effect on top 
      of welcome square.</li>
    <li >That's it! </li>
  </ul>
