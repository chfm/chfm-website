  <strong>Dear-------, <br>
  Greetings from the Chapel Hill Friends Meeting! We are so glad you joined us 
  recently for meeting for worship.</strong></p>
<p><strong> I've enclosed some information about the meeting and our practice 
  to give you more of an idea of what we're about. <br>
  Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would like to talk!</strong></p>
<p><strong> I also want to let you know that we have a great potluck for all on 
  the first Sunday of each month at the rise of meeting (~12:00pm) and we'd love 
  to see you there!<br>
  It's a fun way to get to know people, and for us to get to know you. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Hope to see you again soon. <br>

<h2>How to Make Cards</h2>
<ul>
  <li>If you need more of the colorful welcome squares, use the &#8216;welcome&#8217; 
    document in Google Drive (<strong>Hart, can you tell me where this is?</strong>) 
    to print onto 8.5&#8221;x11&#8221; colorful cardstock and cut into sections.</li>
  <li> Use double-sided sticky tape to adhere colorful welcome square to blank 
    card front.</li>
  <li> Put diagonal parallel strips of washi tape for decorative effect on top 
    of welcome square.</li>
  <li> That&#8217;s it! </li>
</ul>
<h2>Things from Walmart</h2>
<ul>
  <li>set of cards and envelopes (blank). 50 for about $5 (in the scrapbooking 
    supplies aisle)</li>
  <li> book of 8.5&#8221;x11&#8221; colorful cardstock for $5 (also in the scrapbooking 
    supplies aisle)</li>
  <li> metallic washi tape (in the kids art supplies aisle)</li>
