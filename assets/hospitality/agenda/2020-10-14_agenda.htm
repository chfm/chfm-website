<p> Agenda for Hospitality Meeting, Wednesday October 14, 2020</p>
<p>Friends,<br>
  I don't have any Hospitality issues in mind to discuss. We can schedule a meeting 
  if Friends have an issue to raise; or we can schedule a meeting if people would 
  simply like to connect for a while online; or we can skip this month if people 
  are somewhat zoomed out. I'm happy with any of these options. Just let me know.</p>
<p>There is one item to report on: emails to friends@chapelhillfriends were easy 
  this past month. There were only two. One was what seemed to be a legitimate 
  request to forward an email to Emily Condon, which I did. The other was an advertisement 
  for cleaning services which I ignored. </p>
<p>I have created a concise log of emails to friends@chapelhillfriends which we 
  all have access to edit. Your feedback is most welcome on the process that is 
  documented there for responding to emails. And, again, if someone would like 
  to take a turn at being first responder just let me know and I can redirect 
  emails to friends@chapelhillfriends to your email address.</p>
<p>Thank you, Friends.<br>
