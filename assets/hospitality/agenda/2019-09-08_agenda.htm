<p> Agenda for Hospitality Meeting, September 8, 2019</p>
<p>Friends,<br>
  Many of us are going to be absent this Sunday, but we can have a short meeting 
  with whoever is here. Annette and I will be able to report on the meeting that 
  we will have had earlier in the morning with Building and Grounds and the Library 
  Committee to talk about the document on fellowship in the library that we discussed 
  in our Hospitality meeting in July.</p>
<p>For those who won't be here this Sunday and haven't already volunteered, please 
  look at when you can greet and/or help at potluck</p>
<p>Here's the rest of the agenda, We'll meet in the meeting room after worship.</p>
<p>We'll begin with settling in and sharing .</p>
<p>1. We need greeters and potluck helpers for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sept. 15: greeter/refreshments: <strong>Quaker</strong></li>
  <li>Sept. 22: greeter/refreshments: <strong>Jennifer</strong></li>
  <li>Sept. 29: greeter/refreshments:</li>
  <li>Oct. 6: greeter:</li>
  <li>Oct. 6: potluck: <strong>Gwyn</strong></li>
  <li>Oct. 13: greeter/refreshments</li>
</ul>
<p>2. <strong>Feedback on Lotsa Helping Hands</strong><br>
  Is this a good tool for coordinating the response to meal requests? What is 
  the best way to solicit potential volunteers? How best to coordinate with Care 
  and Counsel on meal requests?</p>

<p>3. <strong>Hospitality mission statement</strong><br>
  In September committees should review their mission statement and agree on any 
  changes. Here is our current mission statement (unfortunately it didn't get 
  updated on chapelhillfriends.org):</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The Hospitality Committee seeks to help all feel welcome and to support deepening 
    connections among Meeting members and attenders. The Hospitality Committee 
    schedules greeters for Sunday Meeting for Worship and provides visitors with 
    information about Quaker worship and how to request a personal follow-up through 
    the visitors book; arranges for refreshments for fellowship after the rise 
    of meeting; manages the monthly potluck on the first Sunday of the month; 
    coordinates Meeting response to requests for meals for Friends in need; connects 
    Friends who would like to share their Thanksgiving meal with other members 
    and attenders of Meeting; assists with special occasions such as holiday parties, 
    weddings under the care of the Meeting, new member welcoming parties, and 
    memorial services. Attendance at committee meetings is open to all. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, here is a proposed amended version (changed text in <strong>bold</strong>) 
  including what we agreed on regarding memorials and removing the statement about 
  Thanksgiving .</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>The Hospitality Committee seeks to help all feel welcome and to support deepening 
    connections among Meeting members and attenders. The Hospitality Committee 
    schedules greeters for Sunday Meeting for Worship and provides visitors with 
    information about Quaker worship and how to request a personal follow-up through 
    the visitors book; arranges for refreshments for fellowship after the rise 
    of meeting; manages the monthly potluck on the first Sunday of the month; 
    helps coordinate Meeting response to requests for meals for Friends in need; 
    <strong>collaborates with the Children and Youth Religious Education Committee 
    to put on the annual Christmas party; and a representative from Hospitality 
    along with Care and Counsel work with the family on planning any reception 
    following a memorial service if it is held on the grounds of the meeting.</strong> 
    Attendance at committee meetings is open to all. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>4. <strong>How to handle refreshments during fellowship after worship?</strong><br>
  What kind of refreshments are best? Can we develop a suggestion list? How should 
  we handle reimbursements? We don't have to reach any decisions but we should 
  begin to get a sense of the committee.</p>
<p>Thank you, Friends.<br>
