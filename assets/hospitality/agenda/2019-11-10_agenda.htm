<p> Agenda for Hospitality Meeting, November 10, 2019</p>
<p>Friends,<br>
  Here is a proposed agenda for Sunday, November 10. We'll meet in the Meeting 
  room after 11 o'clock worship and finish by 1:30. Let me know if you would like 
  to add to the agenda and please let me know if you can't attend--and please 
  volunteer by email for greeting and potluck even if you can't attend.</p>
<p>We'll begin with settling in and brief sharing.</p>
<p>1. We need greeters and potluck helpers for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Nov. 10: greeter/refreshments: Jennifer</li>
  <li>Nov. 17: greeter/refreshments:</li>
  <li>Nov. 24: greeter/refreshments: Buzz</li>
  <li>Dec 1: greeter:</li>
  <li>Dec.1: potluck: Gwyn, ____, ____</li>
  <li>Dec.8: greeter/refreshments:</li>
  <li>Dec.15: greeter/refreshments:</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Newcomer teas -- In the interest of finding ways to support newcomers, can 
  we reinstitute newcomer teas?</p>
<p>3. Refreshments during fellowship -- what suggestions do you have for simple 
  and inexpensive items to complement beverage.</p>
<p>4. Replacement for non-functioning freezer in schoolhouse kitchen -- news update.</p>
<p>5. Do we approve updating our mission statement on the CHFM website to include 
  our role in memorials as spelled out in <a href="https://www.chapelhillfriends.org/celebrations.html">Celebration 
  Committee's recommendations</a>, and to remove mention of Thanksgiving? If so, 
  our mission statement is as follows (changed text in <font color="#0000FF">blue</font>):</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The Hospitality Committee seeks to help all feel welcome and to support deepening 
    connections among Meeting members and attenders. The Hospitality Committee 
    schedules greeters for Sunday Meeting for Worship and provides visitors with 
    information about Quaker worship and how to request a personal follow-up through 
    the visitors book; arranges for refreshments for fellowship after the rise 
    of meeting; manages the monthly potluck on the first Sunday of the month; 
    helps coordinate Meeting response to requests for meals for Friends in need; 
    <font color="#0000FF">collaborates with the Children and Youth Religious Education 
    Committee to put on the annual Christmas party; and a representative from 
    Hospitality along with Care and Counsel work with the family on planning any 
    reception following a memorial service if it is held on the grounds of the 
    meeting</font><strong>.</strong> Attendance at committee meetings is open 
    to all. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thank you, Friends.<br>
  Buzz</p>
<p>Reminder:. John will be absent on November 24, so Hospitality needs to set 
  up (make sure greeter materials are ready, set up hot water, cups, sugar, tea, 
  etc.) and clean up afterwards.</p>
