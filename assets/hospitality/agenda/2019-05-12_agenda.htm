    Agenda: May 12<br>
    Friends,<br>
    Are their issues that we need to discuss at this coming Sunday's Hospitality 
    meeting? If there are, let's meet. Otherwise, if there are volunteers for 
    greeting and potluck, can we do this month's meeting by email?</span></p>
  <p>Here are the upcoming dates for meeting, followed by three Hospitality notices 
    (so please read on):</p>
  <p>1. We need greeters and potluck helpers for:</p>
  <p>June 2, greeter: <br>
    June 2, potluck:<br>
    June 9, greeter/refreshments:<br>
    June 16, greeter/refreshments:<br>
    June 23, greeter/refreshments:<br>
    June 30, greeter/refreshments: </p>
  <p style='line-height:
normal'>Reminder: Here are greeters for the rest of this month:</p>
  <p style='line-height:
normal'>May 12, greeter/refreshments: Nancy<br>
    May 19, greeter/refreshments: Annalee<br>
    May 26, greeter/refreshments: Buzz</p>
  <p style='line-height:
normal'>2. In May we are asked to submit remaining reimbursement requests to the 
    Meeting Treasurer. As a reminder, here is the procedure:</p>
</div>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <div class=WordSection1 style="line-height:
normal">Place an envelope containing a letter requesting reimbursement, signed 
      by the requester and by clerk of Hospitality, into the &quot;Finance&quot; 
      mailbox in the library.</div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div class=WordSection1 style="line-height:
normal"> Include in the envelope the original receipt(s) with the items purchased 
      and total highlighted.</div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div class=WordSection1 style="line-height:
normal"> Email can substitute for letter, with scans of receipts attached, originals 
      in envelope in Finance box.</div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div class=WordSection1 style="line-height:
normal"> A reimbursement check is placed in the Hospitality committee mailbox 
      in the library. The treasurer usually sends an email when they have cut 
      a check (so include your email in your letter).</div>
  </li>
</ul>
<div class=WordSection1> 
  <p style='line-height:
normal'>3. Who can assume Annalee's responsibilities after she leaves at the end 
    of June? That means:</p>
</div>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <div class=WordSection1 style="line-height:
normal">Managing the guest book (sending a note to those who leave their mailing 
      address, and sending an email to enews@chapelhill.org to add to the listserv 
      those who leave their email address)</div>
  </li>
  <li>Managing Lotsa Helping Hands website 
    <p>It certainly doesn't have to be one person doing both things. In fact, 
      it is probably two people. Please think about this. When we next meet in 
      June I hope we will have a plan.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<div class=WordSection1> 
  <p style='line-height:
normal'>4. Name tags in the schoolhouse:</p>
  <p style='line-height:
normal'>We have been storing our name tag trays in the Teacher's room next to 
    the bathroom. Unfortunately, the bookcases that held them have been removed, 
    so the name tags, lanyards, peel-and-stick labels, etc. are in the first cabinet 
    in the hallway next to the kitchen (see attached photo). Brad has said he's 
    ok with this but I'm not sure how well this is going to work. There is no 
    cover for the cabinet and the name tags might get knocked about--and they 
    are tricky to get into the cabinet and out. If this doesn't work, I think 
    we will have to put them back in the Meeting house and just not have them 
    in the schoolhouse.</p>
  <p style='line-height:
normal'>Also, regarding the name tags:</p>
</div>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <div class=WordSection1 style="line-height:
normal">John has generously volunteered to put out the name tag trays on Sunday. 
      I'm not clear as to whether he also puts them back. If he doesn't, the greeter 
      needs to do that. And even if he does, the greeter can help.</div>
  </li>
  <li>I think the lanyards, blank name tags, peel-and-stick labels, etc. are most 
    noticeable placed on top of the bookcase at the entrance to the meeting room. 
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Any other thoughts/concerns regarding name tags--or any other issues?</p>
