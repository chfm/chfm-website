<p> Agenda for Hospitality Meeting, Wednesday September 16, 2020, 7pm<br>
  Zoom link: <a href="https://zoom.us/j/99242952623?pwd=bEY0U2UrekpKL1V4WmN3UDVNbkNudz09">https://zoom.us/j/99242952623?pwd=bEY0U2UrekpKL1V4WmN3UDVNbkNudz09</a></p>
<p>Friends,</p>
<p>1. Begin with silence</p>
<p>2. Check-in</p>
<p>3. What do we think of being the first responder for emails to friends@chapelhillfriends.org?</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>It will have been 2 days short of a month since the Hospitality Committee 
    was made first responder and there have been only <s>two</s> four emails in 
    that period. So this seems less anxiety-producing than initially, but we should 
    still discuss what to do going forward.</p>
  <p> Here is what has happened since our last meeting: (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RB1ynQMypdAITRCm1LB714iLrKxE71MG86TSJPwM2Ho/edit">complete 
    history here</a>)</p>
  <ul>
    <li> Aug 18: Hospitality was added to receive emails to friends@chapelhillfriends.org</li>
    <li> Aug 19: Email received inquiring about using Meetilng facilities. Reply 
      sent with info, and matter handed over to Bldg &amp; Grounds</li>
    <li>Aug 20: Request for zoom link to join meeting. Chris had already sent 
      the link, and I added her address to listserv.</li>
    <li>Sept 09: Newsletter of Habitat for Humanity for Orange County (with no 
      request to post it). I asked clerks if anyone wanted to sponsor it in enews 
      and got only negative responses, so no more action taken.</li>
    <li>Sept 10: Newsletter of Orange County Dept. of Ageing (again no request 
      to post it). Again only negative responses from clerks, so no more action 
      taken. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Here is our current plan of action:</p>
  <p><font color="#000000">If the email to friends@chapelhillfriends is:</font></p>
  <ol type="A">
    <li> <font color="#000000" size="+1"><strong>a question like what we used 
      to get while greeting</strong></font><font color="#000000">, I will forward 
      to Hart to handle.</font></li>
    <li><font color="#000000" size="+1"><strong>a question that I think I know 
      how to respond to</strong></font><font color="#000000"> (like the oneregarding 
      use of our facility), I will reply, cc'ing friends@chapelhillfriends, anyone 
      else appropriate, and bcc'ing hospitality-committee@chapelhillfriends.org. 
      If you have a suggestion for further action you can let me (or the entire 
      committee) know.</font></li>
  </ol>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font color="#000000"><strong>Note</strong>: hospitality-committee@chapelhillfriends.org 
      is a new email address you can use that goes to all members of the Hospitality 
      committee</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <ol start="3" type="A">
    <li><font color="#000000" size="+1"><strong>a question that I <em>don't</em> 
      know how to respond to</strong></font><font color="#000000">, I will </font>send 
      it to hospitality-committee@chapelhillfriends, and possibly someone who 
      I think might know, asking for feedback within 24 hours. Then:</li>
  </ol>
  <ul>
    <li>If feedback makes it clear how to respond, I will reply as in #2 above, 
      or pass responsibility onto someone else to respond.</li>
    <li>If I still don't know how to respond, I will send a rather generic email 
      saying we received your query and someone will get back to you within 48 
      hours, cc'ing friend@chapelhillfriend, and bcc'ing hospitality-committee@chapelhillfriends.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<p>4. Anything else?</p>
<p>Closing silence</p>
<p>Thank you, Friends.
