  on March 3. Later this month I will distribute a draft by email for committee 
  members to comment on, revise, and approve.</p>
<p><strong>3. Noise in the foyer: </strong>Jan shared with me that she received 
  a concern from a Friend that there is too much noise in the foyer after the 
  bell is rung. What might we do to encourage silence?</p>
<p><strong>4. Newcomer teas</strong>: Several folks on the previous Hospitality 
  committee as well as the current one have suggested that<br>
  we reinstitute newcomer teas. Lets discuss.</p>
<p>Thank you, Friends.<br>
