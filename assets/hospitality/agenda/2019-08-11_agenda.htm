<p> Agenda for Hospitality Meeting, August 11, 2019</p>
<p>Friends,<br>
  Here's the agenda for our upcoming Hospitality meeting, Sunday, August 11 after 
  worship -- no change from the proposed agenda. We'll meet in the library if 
  it's free, or the meeting room if it's not. So far only Hart and Lori have responded 
  that they can't come. </p>
<p>We'll begin with settling in and sharing (and brief introductions for those 
  who missed our last meeting).</p>
<p>1. We need greeters and potluck helpers for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Aug. 18: greeter/refreshments</li>
  <li>Aug. 25: greeter/refreshments, <strong>Hart</strong></li>
  <li>Sept. 1: greeter:</li>
  <li>Sept. 1: potluck:</li>
  <li>Sept. 8: greeter/refreshments</li>
</ul>
<p>2. What is Hospitality's role at memorial services?<br>
  An ad hoc committee of members from M&amp;W, C&amp;C, and CYRE has been working 
  to put together a document of guidelines for celebrations at the Meeting for 
  posting on our website. And they have asked for our input particularly with 
  regard to our role at memorials. Let's discuss with the goal of putting together 
  a short statement of our role for inclusion in that document.</p>

<p>3.Planning for the coming year<br>
  What topics require discernment? Clearly we can't plan the year in advance, 
  but I'd like to set the stage. Following are some questions that I have in mind 
  to discuss during the year.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Lotsa Helping Hands</strong>: Two years ago we asked Friends to 
    sign up who were willing to be notified when a Friend needed help with meals. 
    Ten people signed up. Should we ask again?</li>
  <li><strong>Refreshments</strong>: What should we provide? How are we reimbursed?</li>
  <li><strong>Visitors</strong>: Should we compile a list of members who are willing 
    to be notified when a visitor would like to be contacted?</li>
  <li><strong>Visitors</strong>: In the past, Hospitality has hosted a tea for 
    recent visitors to the Meeting. Should we do this again?</li>
  <li><strong>Thanksgiving</strong>: Asking for volunteers to host someone at 
    Thanksgiving hasn't worked well the last few years. Should we lay it down 
    or is there something we can do?</li>
</ul>
<p>What other topics would you like to see addressed?</p>
<p>Thank you, Friends.<br>
