<p> Agenda for Hospitality Meeting, Wednesday, March 10, 2021</p>
<p>Friends,<br>
  It's that time again, and once again we have Hospitality business to discuss. 
  Can we meet on Wednesday, March 10, at 7 PM? </p>
<p>Let me know if there's something that you would like to discuss. What I have 
  in mind are the following:</p>
<p>1. The Hospitality annual report is to be presented at business meeting on 
  March 21. A first draft is attached. Please send me your comments/corrections/emendations, 
  and hopefully we can approve a final version at our meeting on March 10 .</p>
<p>2. Since COVID, Hart has not had occasion to send nearly as many welcome notes/emails 
  as before. What can we do to encourage more visitors to sign up? Here are two 
  ideas to discuss:</p>
<ul>
  <li>At Sunday meeting, the tech host puts the following text into chat: &quot;To 
    receive a welcome greeting from Chapel Hill Friends and our weekly eNews, 
    send your email address to news@chapelhillfriends.org&quot;. Jeff Brown has 
    agreed to discuss with Ministry and Worship having the closer repeat this 
    during announcements. I have suggested something like the folllowing: &quot;If 
    you're a visitor to our meeting, you can send an email to news@chapelhillfriends.org 
    explaining that you are a visitor and would like to receive information by 
    email about our meeting&quot;. Any suggestions?</li>
  <li>Since we don't have a physical guest book for visitors to sign, could we 
    not have a virtual guest book on our website? I invite you to imagine what 
    a web page might look like that invites the viewer to leave their contact 
    information, and I will do the same. We can discuss at our meeting and any 
    other ideas you might have</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to business, hopefully we will have time to connect and enjoy each 
  other's company,</p>
<p>Thank you, Friends.<br>
