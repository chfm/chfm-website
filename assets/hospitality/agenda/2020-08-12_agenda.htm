<p> Agenda for Hospitality Meeting, Wednesday August 12, 2020, 7pm (use the same 
  zoom link as Meeting For Worship)</p>
<p>Friends,</p>
<ol>
  <li> 
    <p>Begin with silence</p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p>Check-in</p>
  </li>

    <p>Can Hospitality respond to emails sent to friends@chapelhillfriends.org 
      in the same way that we respond to visitors who leave their contact information?<br>
      <br>
      Background: In pre-covid days, when visitors provided their mailing address 
      in our guestbook, we sent them a <a href="https://www.chapelhillfriends.org/assets/hospitality/ManagingTheGuestbook.htm#welcome">Welcome 
      note</a> (thank you, Hart!) inviting them to get back with questions or 
      to request further contact. With covid, we now send a <a href="https://www.chapelhillfriends.org/assets/hospitality/ManagingTheGuestbook.htm#covid">Welcome 
      Email</a> (Hart again), but very few people have left their email address 
      following worship via Zoom.<br>
      <br>
      However, it turns out that people sometimes send inquiries about our meeting 
      to friends@chapelhillfriends.org. Historically, emails sent to that address 
      are forwarded to the clerk of Meeting and the clerk and co-clerks of Care 
      &amp; Counsel and Ministry &amp; Worship. Also, when Matt Drake and Jan 
      Hutton ceased being clerk or co-clerk, they requested to continue receiving 
      those emails. So, in practice, inquiries to friends@chapelhillfriends.org 
      were responded to by whatever individuals occupied those positions at the 
      time.<br>
      <br>
      Now, Chris would like the Meeting's response to such inquiries be subject 
      to the discernment of a committee, and he requests that the Hospitality 
      committee consider whether we can undertake to be the first recipient of 
      those emails. As I see it, doing so would be a very natural extension of 
      what the committee does, and has done, already (again, see <a href="https://www.chapelhillfriends.org/assets/hospitality/ManagingTheGuestbook.htm">Managing 
      the Guestbook</a> on our webpage). Of course inquiries such as, &quot;What 
      do I do to be married in this Meeting?&quot;, would be forwarded to a different 
      committee to handle.<br>
      <br>
      So, can Hospitality respond to emails sent to friends@chapelhillfriends.org 
      in the same way that we respond to visitors who leave their contact information? 
      Chris would like, if he can, to attend our meeting.</li>
  <li> 
    <p>Anything else?</p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p>Closing silence</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Thank you, Friends.
