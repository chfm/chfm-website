<p> Agenda for Hospitality Meeting, Wednesday February 10, 2021</p>
<p>Friends,<br>
  Can we meet on Wednesday, Feb 10, at 7 PM? We didn't meet last month, so I'd 
  like to connect again. And, there is actually committee business to discuss, 
  but I hope that we can spend most of the time simply connecting.</p>
<p>The committee business is this. This month clerks are tasked with &quot;Ascertaining 
  who on the committee is rotating off and who plans to stay on the committee 
  next year. If new committee members will be needed, generate a list of possible 
  names and submit the list to Nominations Committee.&quot; Our committee members, 
  with the year they are due to rotate off, are::</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>&#8226; Buzz Borchardt* 22<br>
    &#8226; Betsy Fenhagen 23<br>
    &#8226; Hart Pillow 21<br>
    &#8226; Annette Broadwell 21<br>
    &#8226; Quaker Harmon 22<br>
    &#8226; Ben Ray 22<br>
    &#8226; Gordon Davies 22<br>
    &#8226; Evelyn Lee 23<br>
    &#8226; <s>Nancy Dosset</s> 23<br>
    &#8226; Jennifer Leeman 22</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Annette has told me that she intends to rotate off at end of June, and I have 
  not yet heard from Hart. I don't rotate off until 2022, but at the end of June 
  I will have been clerk for 3 years. If someone else would like to take over 
  in July, I will be happy to continue helping -- for example updating the Hospitality 
  page on our website. If not, I will be happy to continue clerking until 2022.</p>
<p>So, prior to our meeting, please think about what our requirements will be 
  for 2020-2021. And, the Nominations Committee has asked us to consider whether 
  our committee should have term limits on committee membership (though I suspect 
  the answer to that question is easy).</p>
<p>Here is a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-RoPw4MO7WTnwIU9IvfxMy93iN6kqo5p_74fpOcFMXE/edit#">log 
  of emails</a> to friends@chapelhillfriends. And, here's a summary of activity 
  since 08/18/20):</p>
<table width="569" border="1" align="left" cellpadding="5">
  <tr> 
    <th width="52"><div align="center">

  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td><div align="center">34</div></td>
    <td><div align="center">3</div></td>
    <td><div align="center">4</div></td>
    <td><div align="center">41</div></td>
    <td><div align="center">1.67</div></td>
    <td><div align="center">83%</div></td>
    <td><div align="center">7%</div></td>
    <td><div align="center">10%</div></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: There are considerably more emails than I last reported because I discovered 
  that a total of 22 emails to friends@chapelhillfriends that had been forwarded 
  to me ended up in my Spam folder and Promotions tab. Fortunately, all of them 
  were rightly ignored (I don't think our meeting needs a drone with 30-minute 
  fly time and wide-angle camera).</p>
<p>Thank you, Friends.<br>
