<p> Agenda for Hospitality Meeting, December 8, 2019</p>
<p>Friends,<br>
  At our last month's meeting we agreed to conduct a joint meeting with the Library 
  committee to discuss our respective desires for a library renovation that both:</p>
<ul>
  <li> makes it a more congenial place for fellowship after worship and for other 
    small-group meetings, and</li>
  <li>enhances its function as a repository of learning</li>
</ul>
<p>Attached is the document regarding fellowship in the library that the Hospitality 
  committee found unity on last June after much discussion and participation by 
  all the committee members.</p>
<p>Our joint meeting will take place in the library after late worship. But, before 
  the joint meeting I would like to have a very brief Hospitality meeting in the 
  Meeting room to line up greeters and potluck helpers and to make sure we're 
  clear on what to do for the upcoming Christmas party, Dec. 15. So, please join 
  us in the Meeting room right after rise of Meeting. And, if you can't join us 
  please volunteer online.</p>
