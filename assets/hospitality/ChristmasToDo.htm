<h2>Christmas To Do </h2>
<ul>
  <li>Arrive at 4:30PM (First Day School sets the date) -- Encourage everyone 
    in the Committee to attend and help.</li>
  <li>We are responsible to set up and facilitate the food and beverage 
    <ul>
      <li>Set up 3 or 4 long tables in school hallway</li>
      <li>Ask Committee members if can loan holiday tablecloths -- Xmas 2019 we 
        used white tablcloths in panty with decorations (holly, pinecones) and 
        it was very successful.</li>
      <li> 2 crock pots and ladles for hot cider (heat up in kitchen and keep 
        warm in crockpots)</li>
      <li>Maple View Eggnog was a big hit</li>
      <li>Purchase: 
        <ul>
          <li>Holiday napkins and small plates (enough for 80)</li>
          <li>Holiday hot beverage cups</li>
          <li>2 half gallons Maple View eggnog (1 gallon total)</li>
          <li>6 half gallons cider ((3 gallons total) Trader Joe's spiced cider 
            is good.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks, Jan and Carolyn <br>
  Sounds good to me. Hospitality is ready to help set up, clean up, and as I understand 
  it, provide egg nog, hot cider, and paper plates and cups. Please let me know 
  if your expectation is different. <br>
  That should do it, Buzz. Thank you. Carolyn<br>
