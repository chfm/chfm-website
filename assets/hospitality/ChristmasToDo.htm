<h2>Christmas To Do </h2>
<p>Jasmine McKewen: &quot;CYRE has <strong>December 15 </strong>tentatively scheduled 
  for the 2019 Christmas party&quot;,</p>
<ul>
  <li>Arrive at 4:30PM (First Day School sets the date) -- Encourage everyone 
    in the Committee to attend and help.</li>
  <li>We are responsible to set up, facilitate the food and beverage, and clean 
    up
<ul>
      <li>Set up 3 or 4 long tables in school hallway</li>
      <li>Xmas 2019 we used the white tablcloths kept in school house pantry with 
        decorations (freshly cut pine boughs and pinecones) and it was very successful, 
        or ask Committee members if someone can loan holiday tablecloths.</li>
      <li> 1 or 2 crock pots and ladles for hot cider (heat up in kitchen and 
        keep warm in crockpots)</li>
      <li>Purchase: 
        <ul>
          <li>Holiday napkins and small plates (enough for 80)</li>
          <li>Holiday disposable or compostable hot beverage cups</li>
          <li>2 half gallons Maple View eggnog (1 gallon total) -- this was a 
            big hit.</li>
          <li>6 half gallons cider ((3 gallons total) Trader Joe's spiced cider 
            is good.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks, Jan and Carolyn <br>
  Sounds good to me. Hospitality is ready to help set up, clean up, and as I understand 
  it, provide egg nog, hot cider, and paper plates and cups. Please let me know 
  if your expectation is different. <br>
  That should do it, Buzz. Thank you. Carolyn<br>
