  <p style='line-height:

    It was wonderful to have so many new members joining us along with returning 
    members. In attendance: Annette, Ben, Buzz, Hart, Jennifer, Quaker.<br>
    </span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; color: #222222;">I think we can meet 
    before late worship next month, but we should start earlier (say, 9:30). I 
    had forgotten the we don't have the full hour since greeting starts at quarter 
    to 11.</span></p>
  <p>1. We opened with settling in and introductions.</p>
  <p>2. Brief description of what we do. Reminder: We now have a <a href="https://www.chapelhillfriends.org/hospitality.html">Hospitality 
    page on the Web</a> (to navigate there, select <strong>Committees</strong> 
    on the menu, then click the &quot;sticky note&quot; icon to the right of <strong>Hospitality</strong>.</p>

<p>4. Guest Book<br>
  Thanks again to Hart for taking on responsibility for the guest book. We decided 
  that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>we should strive, as soon as possible after each Sunday meeting, to send 
    a card to visitors who leave their mailing address, and for visitors who leave 
    their email address to send an email to enews@chapelhillfriends.org requesting 
    to add the visitors to the listserv for weekly eNews.</li>
  <li>if Hart is not at meeting, the greeter will take a picture of guest-book 
    pages where a visitor has signed and email the picture to Hart. Hart is going 
    to begin removing and storing pages that have already been processed.</li>
  <li>We raised the possibility of compiling a list of members who would be willing 
    to meet with visitors who wish to be contacted. Hart already includes her 
    contact information in the card and invites visitors to contact her. So it 
    would be good if we had a list of members who would be willing to go further 
    and meet with the visitors. </li>
  <li>Btw. I will include a description of our guest book process on our web page 
    so that all the Hospitality committee can be familiar with it. </li>
</ul>

  <p style='line-height:

    Attached is the document, Fellowship_in_the_library.pdf, that Annette wrote 
    summarizing the points that the Hospitality committee had discussed and agreed 
    on.</p>
</div>
<p>Annette and Buzz were able to meet with the Library committee after worship 
  and distributed copies of the document for discussion. The Library committee 
  members present read the document and will discuss with members not present. 
  The plan is for the Library committee and Hospitality to meet jointly with building 
  and grounds to discuss the findings and recommendations.</p>
