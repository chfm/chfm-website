<p> Minutes of Hospitality Meeting, Sunday March 8, 2020</p>
<p>Friends,<br>
  We didn't have enough members to hold a meeting, so we can conduct essential 
  business online. First of all, we need greeters and potluck helpers, and then 
  there is information below concerning our budget.</p>
<p>1. We need greeters and potluck helpers for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Mar 15: greeter/refreshments: Buzz</li>
  <li>Mar 22: greeter/refreshments: Quaker</li>
  <li>Mar 29: greeter/refreshments: ______</li>
  <li>Apr 5: greeter: ______</li>
  <li>Apr 5: potluck: Jennifer, _____, _____</li>
  <li>Apr 12: greeter/refreshments: Jennifer</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Budget: In March the committee is asked to submit its budget for the following 
  year. Is our current budget adequate? You can find budget information on our 
  <a href="https://www.chapelhillfriends.org/hospitality.html">Hospitality website</a> 
  (including a hypothetical Hospitality annual budget)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>If my accounting is correct, we have $173 left until end of our budget year 
    (end of June). Half of that will go for buying compostable plates, many of 
    which will be used in the following year, and the remaining money should be 
    adequate for any other expenses that come up (stamps, etc). </p>
  <p>One question that has never been resolved for as long as I have been on the 
    Hospitality committee is how to pay for fellowship snacks. Anyone who provides 
    snacks is entitled to request reimbursement, and Joanna, when she was clerk, 
    used to encourage us to do so. However, assuming 40 fellowships per year (52 
    weeks per year minus 12 potlock weeks equals 40) and assuming $10 per fellowship, 
    that equals $400 or our<em> total budget</em>. In practice, few people have 
    requested reimbursement, and the cost, I figure, can be held to around $8 
    per fellowship (not counting cofee, tea, cream, sugar, etc. which definitely 
    come out of the budget).</p>
  <p>So, I propose asking for the same amount for next year, i.e., <strong>$400</strong> 
    (in January, if it looks like we are going to go over, then we can request 
    a supplement). </p>
  <p>Your thoughts?</p>

<p>4. Newcomer teas/potlucks: We can discuss at our next meeting</p>
<p>Thank you, Friends.<br>
