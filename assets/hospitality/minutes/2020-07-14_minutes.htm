<p>Friends, </p>
<p>Thank you so much for attending. Joining online were: Annette, Buzz, Evelyn, 
  Gordon (with guest appearance by Betsy Brinson), Hart, Jennifer, and Quaker. 
  We missed very much the presence of Ben, Betsy (Fenhagen), and Nancy and hope 
  they will be able to attend next time. </p>
<p>With little Hospitality business to discuss, we spent the time connecting with 
  each other. This is a very special community and I feel privileged to be a part 
  of it and am grateful for your participation. </p>
<p>Thank you so much! Buzz </p>
