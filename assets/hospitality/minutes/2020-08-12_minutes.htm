<p> Minutes of Hospitality Meeting, Wednesday August 12, 2020</p>
<p>Friends,<br>
  We had a very substantive meeting. Attending: Annette, Ben, Buzz, Chris, Evelyn, 
  Gordon, Quaker (and Jasmine stopped by on her way to Finance) </p>
<p>Buzz began the meeting by summarizing what Hospitality has been doing up to 
  now in welcoming visitors to our meeting. Chris then presented his proposal 
  which is as follows: (Please speak up if your understanding is different than 
  described here)</p>
<ol>
  <li>Hospitality will continue (i.e., Hart) sending a welcome email to anyone 
    who leaves their email address in chat during zoom worship, and Buzz will 
    add the email address to the listserv.</li>
  <li>Messages sent to <strong>friends@chapelhillfriends.org </strong>will be 
    forwarded to: 
    <ul>
      <li>Clerk of Meeting</li>
      <li>Clerk of Ministry and Worship</li>
      <li>Clerk of Care and Counsel</li>
      <li>Clerk of Hospitality</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Clerk of Hospitality is new; Jan Hutton and Matt Dake (ex-Clerks who had 
      remained on the distribution list) will no longer receive.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Hospitality is the designated first responder for messages to <strong>friends@chapelhillfriends.org</strong>. 
    <p><strong>Explanation</strong>: It is imperative that such messages be responded 
      to promptly (within 48 hours or less). To ensure this, it is important that 
      it be clear who is responsible for responding so as to avoid the situation 
      where no one responds, thinking that someone else is going to. (Similarly, 
      it is important that not everyone respond, thinking that it is their responsibility.) 
      So, it will be the responsibility of the Hospitality Committee to respond 
      promptly, replying-all, to <em>every</em> message to friends@chapelhillfriends.org. 
      Replying-all means that the person who sent the email receives the response 
      as does everyone on the distribution list above. Clerks on the distribution 
      list who receive the reponse are thereby notified if further action is required 
      by them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The intention of this proposal is that meeting business be handled by committees 
    rather than by individuals acting from their own leading.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, how will Hospitality respond to emails to friends@chapelhillfriends.org? 
  The following are my first thoughts. I propose that we discuss at our next Hospitality 
  meeting, and <em>please</em> respond beforehand with your own ideas.</p>
<ol>
  <li>If the email is a simple request for information about our Meeting, Clerk 
    of Hospitality (Buzz) will forward the email to Hart who will <strong>reply-all 
    </strong>with a welcome email, and Buzz will add the sender's email address 
    to the listserv.</li>
  <li>If the email is something other, then Buzz will either: 
    <ul>
      <li>Draft a response and send it to all (some?) members of Hospitality for 
        suggestions within 24 hours, after which Buzz will reply-all to the email 
        with the amended response.</li>
      <li>Ask someone else on the Committee (or someone outside the Committee?) 
        to draft a response and send it to all (some) members of Hospitality for 
        suggestions within 24 hours, after which that person will reply-all to 
        the email with the amended response.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Some thoughts</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The reply could be a Quaker equivalent to the generic email: &quot;Thank 
    you for your inquiry. We value your interest and someone will repy to you 
    within 48 hours&quot;. But, hopefully, we will have something more helpful 
    such as &quot;There is general information about marriage in the meeting here 
    on our website, but someone from Ministry and Worship will reply to you within 
    48 hours&quot;.<br>
  </li>
  <li>In addition to replying-all, the person responding might also want to send 
    an email to one or all of the recipients of friends@chapelhillfriends.org 
    offering additional information (such as previous inquiries from the same 
    person or more information about the subject of inquiry).<br>
  </li>
  <li>I think this is something new for Hospitality. In the past we have greeted 
    visitors and asked if they have attended Quaker Meeting before, offered information 
    and answered questions. But I am not aware of our ever having received inquiries 
    concerning e.g., marriage or memorial service within the Meeting. On the other 
    hand, I think this is something that we can do, and Hospitality has had little 
    to do since coronavirus, so this is an opportunity. However, what to do and 
    how to do it will require discernment and practice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you, Friends.
