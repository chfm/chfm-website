<p> Minutes of Hospitality Meeting, Sunday February 9, 2020</p>
<p>Friends,<br>
  We had a very productive and enjoyable meeting. Here is what we discussed (please 
  let me know of additions and correction).</p>
<p>1. Greeters and potluck helpers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Feb.16 greeter/refreshments: Annette</li>
  <li>Feb.23: greeter/refreshments: Quaker</li>
  <li>Mar.1: greeter: Jennifer</li>
  <li>Mar.1: potluck: Annette, Ben, Quaker, and ?</li>
  <li>Mar 8: greeter/refreshments: Buzz</li>
</ul>
<p>2. <strong>Annual report</strong>: Later this month I will distribute a draft 
  by email for committee members to comment on and approve by March 3 when it 
  needs to be sent to Publications.</p>
<p><strong>3. Noise in the foyer: </strong>We agreed that it is a matter of greeter 
  disrcretion whether to ask someone to wait in the library or let them go into 
  Meeting. But some suggestions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If someone is going into the Meeting late, then holding the door for them 
    allows them to focus on finding a place and you can ensure that the door closes 
    quietly.</li>
  <li>Make sure the door between library and Meeting room is closed. And closing 
    it can signal to those in the library that Meeting has begun.</li>
  <li>It is better to ask Friends to please take their conversation outside rather 
    than asking them to be quiet.</li>
  <li>And, asking someone you know who won't be offended can serve as a signal 
    to others.</li>
  <li>Ringing the bell again even though it has already been rung can at least 
    assure members in Meeting that the greeter is trying to achieve silence even 
    if the effort doesn't succeed.</li>
  <li>An announcement might be made at MWAB about the need for silence--but not 
    after worship as there is often a surfeit of announcements.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Newcomer teas</strong>: We are at unity that newcomer teas are desirable 
  and that the Hospitality Committee should resume this role perhaps every six 
  months. One idea is to sponsor a light luncheon in the schoolhouse after Meeting. 
  Since Leslie Rountree expressed an interest on the part of M&amp;W in reviving 
  newcomer teas, Jennifer volunteered to talk with Leslie to see if she would 
  want to offer a tea at some point in her home to kick this off.. <br>
  Thank you, Jennifer, and thank you, Friends.</p>
