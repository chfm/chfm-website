    Minutes: May 12<br>
    Friends,<br>
    Even though we didn't meet last week, it occurs to me that I should send out 
    minutes because we still need volunteers to greet and help at potluck, and 
    there are a couple other items of importance, so please read on:</span></p>
  <p>1. We need greeters and potluck helpers for:</p>
  <p>May 26, greeter: <font color="#0000FF">Nancy</font> (substituting for Buzz)<br>
    June 2, greeter: <font color="#0000FF">Buzz</font><br>
    June 2, potluck: <font color="#0000FF">Annette</font>, <font color="#0000FF">Hart 
    (setting up), Matt, Nancy</font><br>
    June 9, greeter/refreshments: <font color="#0000FF">?</font><br>
    June 16, greeter/refreshments: <font color="#0000FF">?</font><br>
    June 23, greeter/refreshments: <font color="#0000FF">?</font><br>
    June 30, greeter/refreshments: <font color="#0000FF">?</font></p>
  <p style='line-height:
normal'>2. Reminder that in May we are asked to submit remaining reimbursement 
    requests (refer to the most recent agenda for the procedure).</p>
</div>
<div class=WordSection1> 
  <p style='line-height:

    of June? That means:</p>

<ul>
  <li> 
    <div class=WordSection1 style="line-height:

  <li>Managing Lotsa Helping Hands website:<font color="#0000FF"> We still need 
    someone. Let's talk about this next month. I have begun documenting how to 
    use and administer Lotsa Helping Hands.</font></li>

</div>
<ul>
  <li>John gets the boxes with lanyards, blank name tags, etc. out of the cabinet, 
    but <font color="#0000FF"><strong><font size="+1">we need to open the boxes 
    and make them accessible</font></strong>. I think they are most noticeable 
    placed on top of the bookcase at the entrance to the meeting room. (see attached 
    picture)</font></li>
  <li> 
    <div class=WordSection1 style="line-height:

      --<font color="#0000FF"> <font color="#000000">but</font><strong> <font size="+1">we 
      are responsible for putting them away</font></strong></font>. <font color="#0000FF">They 
      go in the cabinet next to the kitchen (see attached picture). You can put 
      the smallest plastic box inside one of the bigger boxes. Then I find it's 
      best to put the two bigger plastic boxes from back to front on the bottom 
      of the cabinet. The name tag trays can fit sideways on top of the plastic 
      boxes.</font></div>
