<p> Minutes for Hospitality Meeting, December 8, 2019</p>
<p>Attending: Annette, Ben, Buzz</p>
<p>Friends,<br>
  So many people were otherwise disposed that we didn't have a Hospitality meeting, 
  but we did meet with the Library committee to discuss desired renovations to 
  the library. More about that below, but first a more pressing issue:<br>
  <strong>WE NEED A GREETER FOR THIS COMING SUNDAY</strong> and for the following 
  Sundays. Please volunteer by email (Annette and I are gone this coming weekend 
  visiting my new grandson).</p>
<p> We need greeters and potluck helpers for: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Dec.15: greeter/refreshments: ______</li>
  <li>Dec. 15: <a href="https://www.chapelhillfriends.org/assets/hospitality/ChristmasToDo.htm">Christmas 
    party</a>: Jennifer, Quaker, Hart (I'll send out more information shortly)</li>
  <li>Dec.22: greeter/refreshments: Buzz</li>
  <li>Dec.29: greeter/refreshments: ______</li>
  <li>Jan.5: greeter: ______</li>
  <li>Jan.5: potluck: Annette, _____, _____</li>
  <li>Jan 12: greeter/refreshments: ______</li>
</ul>
<p>Annette, Ben, and Buzz met with the library committee (Dave, Lloyd, Allie, 
  Eloise attending) and John the Quaker also attending. We agreed to aim to put 
  discussion of library renovations on the agenda for January MWAB.</p>
<p>In the meantime we will work to put together a presentation for MWAB with the 
  general issues on which we have reached unity, such as flooring, ceiling, and 
  lighting more consistent with the Meeting room and opening up the library space 
  to provide a more efficient space for serving coffee tea and light snacks to 
  support fellowship after meeting. </p>
<p>Thank you, Friends.<br>
  Buzz</p>
