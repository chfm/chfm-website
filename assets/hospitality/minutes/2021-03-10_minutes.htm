<p> Minutes of Hospitality Meeting, Wednesday, March 10, 2021</p>
<p>Attending: Annette Broadwell, Ben Ray, Buzz Borchardt, Gordon Davies, Hart 
  Pillow, Quaker Harmon, </p>
<p> 1. The Hospitality annual report: was reviewed and typos noted. Otherwise 
  it met with approval and was read at the business meeting on March 21. </p>
<p>2. Ideas to encourage more visitors to sign up:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Closer announcement at end of meeting: M&amp;W has been overwhelmed with 
    pandemic-related questions and has not yet considered this request. I have 
    reminded them once again.</li>
  <li>Virtual guest book: We have not had any response from P&amp;C. Quaker suggested, 
    and demoed, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Ar33NgUjxalZniNu40xEB-0PKELc5FCuxQ6j6yiHC-4/edit">Google 
    Forms</a>, as an alternative at least until P&amp;C provides us an alternative 
    that doesn't require going outside of our website. In fact, Google Forms looks 
    like this is a very good option to implement and see if P&amp;C will approve 
    it. Quaker also pointed out that links to the virtual guestbook should appear 
    in multiple places on our website, e.g.,<a href="https://www.chapelhillfriends.org/visit-and-learn.html">Contact</a>, 
    <a href="https://www.chapelhillfriends.org/visit-and-learn.html">Visit and 
    Learn</a>, <a href="https://www.chapelhillfriends.org/zoom/online.html">Online 
    Meeting</a>, and the <a href="https://www.chapelhillfriends.org/">Home</a> 
    page itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>3. The remainder of the hour was spent in checking in.</p>
<p>Thank you, Friends.<br>
