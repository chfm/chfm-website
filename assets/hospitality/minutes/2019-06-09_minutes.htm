    Here are the very late and somewhat abbreviated minutes from our last meeting.</span></p>

  <p>1. The main order of business -- <strong>we still need greeters</strong> 
    for the following days:</p>

<ul>
  <li> 
    <div class=WordSection1> June 30, greeter/refreshments: </div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div class=WordSection1>July 7, greeter/refreshments (no potluck in July -- 
      members will be invited to bring finger foods to share during hospitality 
      after worship)</div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div class=WordSection1> July 14, greeter/refreshments: </div>
  </li>
</ul>
<div class=WordSection1> 
  <p style='line-height:
normal'>3. Fellowship and the Library<br>
    Annette has distributed a document describing changes we would like to see 
    made to the library. As soon as everyone on the committee has responded we 
    will ask to meet with the Library Committee. Even though Annalee, Joanna, 
    and Nancy will have left our committee, we hope you will all participate in 
    that meeting because you have the most recent and relevant experience with 
    hosting fellowship (Annalee, of course, will be on the Library Committee).</p>

<div class=WordSection1> 
  <p style='line-height:
normal'>3. Lotsa Helping Hands<br>
    As of yet, no one has expressed interest in assuming this responsibility. 
    Since Buzz has worked on understanding and documenting how to administer the 
    website, he volunteers to assume responsibility at least temporarily. Once 
    the newly constituted committee meets in July, we can see if someone is interested. 
    It would be good if there is also someone familiar with the site who can act 
    as backup. </p>
