  <p style='line-height:

  <p>Attending: Annette, Ben, Buzz, Evelyn, Gordon, Hart, Jennifer, Quaker</p>
  <p>Both Annette and Hart will be cycling off the committee in June, 2021. The 
    committee agreed that we will need 2 more members for 2021-2022. We further 
    agreed to ask Nominations to ask Annalee Harkins if she is willing to rejoin 
    the committee, which would be ideal particularly if she would pick up the 
    responsibility for writing welcome notes/emails and contacting visitors (which 
    Hart had picked up previously from Annalee). In response to a Nominations 
    Committee question, no one on the committee expressed the need for or desirability 
    of a term limit on membership on the Hospitality committee.</p>
  <p>The rest of the meeting time was spent in connecting and enjoying each other's 
    company.</p>
