<h4>Library Renovation:</h4>
<p>There seems to be unity with the two committees on the following points (Lloyd 
  and/or John may say a word about our joint efforts at the forum on renovation, 
  Jan 26.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fellowship after MFW should be in the library and not downstairs.</li>
  <li> To facilitate serving coffee and tea during fellowship an enclosed tea/coffee 
    cabinet with small bar sink and capacity to store cups and beverage supplies 
    is desirable.</li>
  <li> The island in the middle of the library should be removed to make space 
    for the library, and a smaller (perhaps moveable) table be used for serving 
    refreshments.</li>
  <li> The carpet should be replaced with real or fake wood similar in appearance 
    to that in the Meeting room.</li>
  <li> The ceiling and lighting should be the similar to that in the Meeting room.</li>
  <li> The accordion divider should be removed.</li>
  <li>The bulky cabinet in the back that overlaps a bookcase could be replaced.</li>
  <li> Should the fixed benches be replaced? Together with removing the free-standing 
    cabinet, that would free up space for flexible comfortable and more user-friendly 
    seating.</li>
  <li> Given all the renovations needed to the library, would it make sense to 
    get a preliminary architectural drawing to help envision how the space might 
    better meet our needs now and in the future?<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p> Thank you, Friends.<br>
