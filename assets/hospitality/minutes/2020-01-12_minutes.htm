<p> Minutes of Hospitality Meeting, Sunday January 12, 2020</p>
<p> We had a brief but good Hospitality meeting before a very productive joint 
  Library/Hospitality meeting. Notes below:</p>
<p><strong>Attending</strong>: Annette, Ben, Buzz, Gordon, Jennifer, Quaker</p>
<h4>Greeters/Potluck Helpers:</h4>

  <li>Feb.2: potluck: Jennifer, Annette, Ben</li>
  <li>Feb 9: greeter/refreshments: Jennifer</li>
</ul>
<h4>Library Renovation:</h4>
<p>There seems to be unity with the two committees on the following points (Lloyd 
  and/or John may say a word about our joint efforts at the forum on CHFM Renovations, 
  Jan 26.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fellowship after MFW should be in the library and not downstairs.</li>
  <li> To facilitate serving coffee and tea during fellowship an enclosed tea/coffee 
    cabinet with small bar sink and capacity to store cups and beverage supplies 
    is desirable.</li>
  <li> The island in the middle of the library should be removed to make space 
    for the library, and a smaller (perhaps moveable) table be used for serving 
    refreshments.</li>
  <li> The carpet should be replaced with real or fake wood similar in appearance 
    to that in the Meeting room.</li>
  <li> The ceiling and lighting should be the similar to that in the Meeting room.</li>
  <li> The accordion divider should be removed.</li>
  <li> Given all the renovations needed to the library, a preliminary drawing 
    of the library by an architect is desirable.</li>
  <li>The fixed benches should be replaced with comfortable chairs to provide 
    more flexible seating (this seemed to be the general feeling but not sure 
    if there was unity)<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p> Thank you, Friends.<br>
