</ul>
<p>2. <strong><font color="#990099">Newcomer teas</font></strong>: The sense of 
  those present was:</p>
<ul>
  <li>not until after the holidays</li>
  <li>hold it after late meeting, preferably in someone's house</li>
  <li>desirable to provide lunch</li>
  <li>in addition to recent visitors, invite representative(s) from each committee 
    who can talk about their committee (make teas informative as well as social)</li>
</ul>
<p>3. <strong><font color="#990099">Refreshment ideas</font></strong>: Quaker 
  has started a Google doc that she will share so that we can add our ideas.</p>
<p>4. <strong><font color="#990099">Schoolhouse freezer replacement</font></strong>: 
  We need to ensure that our needs are taken into consideration. John has learned 
  that the school house is close to finding a replacement and has emailed everyone 
  concerned to make sure that all are aware.</p>
<p>5. <strong><font color="#990099">Fellowship and the library</font></strong>: 
  John asked if the Library Committee could join our Hospitality meeting to discuss 
  renovation plans for the library (attending: Allie, Annalee, Dave, Lloyd). </p>
<ul>
  <li>We agreed that the two committees will meet in the library to discuss after 
    late worship on <strong>Dec 8</strong>.</li>
  <li>Buzz will redistribute to both committees the document on fellowship in 
    the library that the Hospitality Committee previously approved </li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you, Friends.<br>
  Buzz</p>
<p>Reminder:. John will be absent on November 24, so Hospitality needs to set 
  up (make sure greeter materials are ready, set up hot water, cups, sugar, tea, 
  etc.) and clean up afterwards.</p>
