    Minutes, April 14, 2019<br>

  <p style='line-height:
normal'>2. Guest Book/Lotsa Helping Hands: <br>
    Annalee explained how she makes the welcome cards that are sent to visitors 
    who leave their mailing address. While we can't expect Annalee's successor 
    to have her artistic flair and calligraphy skills, Annalee has agreed to write 
    up what she does to facilitate someone taking over.</p>
  <p style='line-height:
normal'>Lotsa Helping Hands: It seems there is some unclarity regarding this, 
    e.g., is it only for meals or other requests as well? Are there enough people 
    signed up? Next month, let's talk about this and if we are at unity we can 
    check with Care and Counsel to make sure they have the same understanding 
    as us.</p>
  <p style='line-height:
normal'>3. Questions and concerns about greeting in the schoolhouse?</p>
</div>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <div class=WordSection1 style="line-height:
normal"> Annalee suggested we have a couple of signs for posting in the schoolhouse 
      on Sunday (e.g., &quot;Turn off cell phones&quot;). She volunteered to send 
      the text to John who volunteered to make the laminated signs (Thank you, 
      both!)</div>
  </li>
  <li>John requested that the committee pronounce definitively on where the refreshment 
    table should go, and we agreed that it should be in the long hallway and not 
    next to the bathroom where there is insufficient space.</li>
  <li>In case you've wondered while greeting, the nursery is still downstairs 
    in the Meeting house in spite of renovations.</li>
</ul>
<div class=WordSection1> 
  <p style='line-height:
normal'>4. Name tags: <br>
    Personally, it appears to me that people are getting used to the new system 
    and that it is starting to work fairly smoothly--certainly better than the 
    old system. Using poster board inside the plastic holders makes them more 
    rigid and stand up better in the wood trays. The color coding suggested by 
    Catherine Alguire makes it easier for people to return their name tag to the 
    proper tray -- and makes it easy for us to recognize misplaced tags. And, 
    I have begun replacing the metal clips with plastic ones that are, perhaps, 
    somewhat lighter and, more importantly, seem to swivel more easily in the 
    holders if someone wants to change the position of the clip.</p>
  <p style='line-height:
normal'>John has generously volunteered to put out the name tag holders and supplies 
    before worship. But, if he is overwhelmed with something else, the trays and 
    supplies are on the bookcase in the Teacher's room next to the bathroom, and 
    it seems to me that we might help put them back after worship if you are not 
    busy talking with visitors. </p>
