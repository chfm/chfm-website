<p> Minutes for Hospitality Meeting, Wednesday September 16, 2020</p>
<p>We had a productive meeting, and it was enjoyable connecting. Attending: Annette, 
  Buzz, Evelyn, Gordon, Jennifer, Quaker</p>
<p>We discussed our role as first responder for emails to friends@chapelhillfriends.org. 
  Points made include the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Limit the number of emails to committee members--blind-copy everyone only 
    when feedback is wanted or it is something they should know.</li>
  <li>Rotate responsibility for responding. Rather than establishing a schedule, 
    can we try sinply allowing members to volunteer as they are led? I have no 
    desire to be the sole responder.</li>
  <li>Don't hesitate to ask for advice on how to respond not only within the Committee 
    but also outside--whoever has the expertise.</li>
  <li>The question was raised as to how we can know that an email is being handled 
    when responsibility for responding is passed to another committee. One suggestion 
    is for whoever responds to blind-copy the response to the person from Hospitality 
    who delegated the responsibility. The suggestion was also made to discuss 
    this at the upcoming Clerk's Retreat, and I have emailed Chris to ask for 
    it to be put on the agenda.</li>
  <li>Maintain a log of actions taken to ensure that emails have been responded 
    to. (will be useful when it comes time for annual report)</li>
  <li>Something I've forgotten?</li>
</ul>
<p>We also discussed the desirability of collecting and making members' photographs 
  available as a way of helping members connect with one another. For example, 
  a pdf version of the Directory that included photographs is possible. However, 
  the sense of the Committee seems to be that most members don't want their picture 
  and identity made publicly available. </p>
<p>Thank you, Friends.<br>
  Buzz</p>
<p> For reference purposes, here is a revised plan of action taking account of 
  the suggestions (note: &quot;responder&quot; means whoever from the committee 
  is currently responsible for first response)</p>
<p><font color="#000000">If the email to friends@chapelhillfriends is:</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font color="#000000" size="+1"><strong>a question like what we used to 
    get while greeting</strong></font><font color="#000000">, responder forwards 
    to Hart to handle.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000000" size="+1"><strong>a question that responder knows 
    how to respond to</strong></font><font color="#000000">, responder replies, 
    cc'ing friends@chapelhillfriends and anyone else appropriate.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000000" size="+1"><strong>a question that responder <em>doesn't</em> 
    know how to respond to</strong></font><font color="#000000">, responder sends</font> 
    it to hospitality-committee@chapelhillfriends, or anyone else who responder 
    thinks might know, asking for feedback within 24 hours. Then: 
    <ul>
      <li>If feedback makes it clear how to respond, responder replies as in #2 
        above, or passes responsibility onto someone else to respond.</li>
      <li>If responder still doesn't know how to respond, responder sends a generic 
        email saying we received your query and someone will get back to you within 
        48 hours, cc'ing friends@chapelhillfriends.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>And, here's a summary of emails received so far (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RB1ynQMypdAITRCm1LB714iLrKxE71MG86TSJPwM2Ho/edit">complete 
  email text here</a>):</p>
<ul>
  <li> Aug 19: Email received inquiring about using Meetilng facilities. Reply 
    sent with info about renting our facility, and matter handed over to Bldg 
    &amp; Grounds</li>
  <li>Aug 20: Request for zoom link to join meeting. Chris had already sent the 
    link, and I added her address to listserv.</li>
  <li>Sept 09: Newsletter of Habitat for Humanity for Orange County (with no request 
    to post it). I asked clerks if anyone wanted to sponsor it in enews and got 
    only negative responses, so no more action taken.</li>
  <li>Sept 10: Newsletter of Orange County Dept. of Ageing (again no request to 
    post it). Again only negative responses from clerks, so no more action taken. 
  </li>
</ul>
