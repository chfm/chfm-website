<h1>Zoom Workarounds</h1>
<p>If you aren't able to install Zoom Client for Meetings on your computer, or 
  your computer lacks a built-in camera or microphone, there are several possible 
  workarounds:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#browser">Run Zoom in a Browser</a></li>
  <li><a href="#webcam">Run Zoom with a Webcam</a> </li>
  <li><a href="#headphones">Run Zoom with Headphones</a></li>
  <li><a href="#telephone">Listen to Zoon on a Telephone</a></li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="browser"></a>Run Zoom in a Browser</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>If you aren't able to install Zoom Client for Meetings on your computer, 
    you can still run Zoom in a browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc).<br>
    However, functionality varies with the browser&#8212;you might not see what 
    others see (works best in Chrome). Of course this assumes that your computer 
    has camera and microphone.</p>
  <p>After clicking on the zoom link, click <strong>Click here </strong>to open 
    Zoom in your browser.</p>
  <blockquote>

  </blockquote>
  <p>Alternatively, you can click <strong>download &amp; run Zoom</strong> to 
    first install Zoom on your computer. However, there will be a delay before 
    you can join the meeting, so you might want to run Zoom in your browser and 
    install it later.</p>
  </blockquote>
  
<h2><a name="webcam"></a>Run Zoom with a Webcam </h2>
<blockquote> 
  <p> If your computer lacks both a camera and a microphone, purchasing a webcam 
    with microphone is ideal. But, expect slow delivery for new orders&#8212;webcams 
    seem to be in high demand online along with everything else.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a name="headphones"></a>Run Zoom with Headphones</h2>
<blockquote> 
  <p>If your computer doesn't have a microphone allowing you to speak, you can 
    use headphones or earbuds with an integrated mic.</p>
  <p><strong>Note</strong>: Older machines that have different input jacks for 
    audio and mic might require a splitter to provide for both jacks. Newer machines 
    with integrated audio will use a single input for both audio and mic (no splitter 
    required). Headphones with a USB connector also might work.</p>
  <p>Headphones won&#8217;t allow others to see you, but you will be able to see 
    others and to speak. If your computer is on the floor, you will need to by 
    headphones with a long cord. Headphones with mic should be available for under 
    $25 at drugstores. </p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a name="telephone"></a>Listen to Zoom on a Telephone</h2>
<blockquote> 
  <p>If you have a problem with your computer and don't have a smartphone, you 
    can still listen to a zoom meeting on a telephone. You won't be able to see 
    or speak, but you will be able to hear (unless, of course, there is silence).</p>
  <p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Zoom meeting invitations designate which dial-in numbers are toll-free 
      by adding &quot;Toll Free&quot; in parentheses after the number. If you 
      do not see a parentheses after the dial-in number, then it is likely a toll 
      number</li>
    <li>If you decide to use a toll number to join a Zoom meeting, you will be 
      charged based on the rates of your phone service provider.</li>
    <li>Using a dial-in number for your country will be treated as a regular phone 
      call. If you choose to use a dial-in number outside of your country it will 
      be treated as a long distance call.</li>
    <li>Unlimited local cell phone calls are generally free under most cell phone 
      plans.</li>
  </ul>
