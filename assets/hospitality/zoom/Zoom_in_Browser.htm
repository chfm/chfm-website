<h1>Zoom Workarounds</h1>
<p>If you aren't able to install Zoom Client for Meetings on your computer, or 
  your computer lacks a built-in camera or microphone, there are several possible 
  workarounds:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#browser">Zoom in a Browser</a></li>
  <li><a href="#webcam">Zoom with a Webcam</a> </li>
  <li><a href="#headphones"> Zoom with Headphones</a></li>
  <li><a href="#telephone">Zoon by Telephone</a></li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="browser"></a>Zoom in a Browser</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>If you aren't able to install Zoom Client for Meetings on your computer, 
    you can still run Zoom in a browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc).<br>
    However, functionality varies with the browser&#8212;you might not see what 
    others see (works best in Chrome). Of course this assumes that your computer 
    has camera and microphone.</p>
  <p>After clicking on the zoom link, click <strong>Click here </strong>to open 
    Zoom in your browser.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><img src="images/zmOpen2.gif" width="618" height="260" border="1"></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Alternatively, you can click <strong>download &amp; run Zoom</strong> to 
    first install Zoom on your computer. However, there will be a delay before 
    you can join the meeting, so you might want to run Zoom in your browser and 
    install it later.</p>
  </blockquote>
  
<h2><a name="webcam"></a>Zoom with a Webcam </h2>
<blockquote> 
  <p> If your computer lacks both a camera and a microphone, purchasing a webcam 
    with microphone is ideal. But, expect slow delivery for new orders&#8212;webcams 
    seem to be in high demand online along with everything else.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a name="headphones"></a>Zoom with Headphones</h2>
<blockquote> 
  <p>If your computer doesn't have a microphone allowing you to speak, you can 
    use headphones or earbuds with an integrated mic.</p>
  <p><strong>Note</strong>: Older machines that have different input jacks for 
    audio and mic might require a splitter to provide for both jacks. Newer machines 
    with integrated audio will use a single input for both audio and mic (no splitter 
    required). Headphones with a USB connector also might work.</p>
  <p>Headphones won&#8217;t allow others to see you, but you will be able to see 
    others and to speak. If your computer is on the floor, you will need to by 
    headphones with a long cord. Headphones with mic should be available for under 
    $25 at drugstores. </p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a name="telephone"></a>Zoom by Telephone</h2>
<blockquote> 
  <p>If you have a problem with your computer and don't have a smartphone, you 
    can still participate in a zoom meeting on a telephone. Look for the number 
    to call in the weekly eNews.</p>
  <p><strong>Sample zoom by telephone:</strong></p>
  <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">You:&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><font size="+1">929-205-6099</font></strong></font> 
    (or another number)<br>
    <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Zoom:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>Welcome 
    to zoom. Enter your meeting ID followed by #<br>
    <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">You:&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><font size="+1">123 
    4567 8910</font></strong></font><font size="+1"><strong>#</strong></font><br>
    <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Zoom:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>Enter 
    your participant ID followed by #. Otherwise just press # to continue*.<br>
    <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">You:&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><font size="+1">#</font></strong></font><br>
    <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Zoom:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>Please 
    enter the meeting password followed by #<br>
    <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">You:&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><font size="+1">123456</font></strong></font><font size="+1"><strong>#</strong></font><br>
    <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Zoom:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>You 
    are in the meeting now. There are 10 participants in the meeting.</p>
  <p>*You have a participant ID only if you have already entered the meeting in 
    another way (e.g., through a computer). If so, you can enter the particpant 
    ID once you are in the meeting by entering <strong>#Participant ID# </strong>on 
    your phone.</p>
  <p><strong>Phone controls (use your phone's dial pad)</strong></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>*6 - Toggle mute/unmute<br>
      *9 - Raise hand (<strong>Note</strong>: The notification to host is not 
      very noticeable. Don't be offended if you are not recognized)</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>Sample interaction:<br>
    </strong><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">You:&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><font size="+1">*6</font></strong></font><br>
    <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Zoom:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>You 
    are muted. You can unmute yourself by pressing *6<br>
    <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">You:&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><font size="+1">*6</font></strong></font><br>
    <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Zoom:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>You 
    are unmuted <br>
    <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">You:&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="+1"><strong>*9</strong></font></font><br>
    <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Zoom:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>The 
    host will be informed that you would like to speak.</p>
  <p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Zoom invitations designate toll-free numbers by adding &quot;(Toll Free)&quot;. 
      If you do not see parentheses after the number, then it is likely a toll 
      number</li>
    <li>If you dial a toll number, you will be charged based on the rates of your 
      phone service provider. If you dial a number outside the US it is treated 
      as a long distance call.</li>
    <li>Cell phone calls are generally free under most cell phone plans.</li>
  </ul>
