# Rent our Facilities

The Chapel Hill Friends Meeting meetinghouse and schoolhouse are available for
rental, with some limitations.  We especially welcome groups with purposes such
as spiritual growth, equality, peace, simplicity, stewardship, and integrity.

Here is our [Building Use Form]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/PDF/building-use-form.pdf) with prices and policies.

See our [building use calendar](/bucalendar.html) for availability.  

To inquire or to learn more about renting our facilities, please contact the
Building and Grounds Committee at <a href="mailto:buildingsandgrounds@chapelhillfriends.org">buildingsandgrounds@chapelhillfriends.org</a>
