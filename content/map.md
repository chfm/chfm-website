    <p>The Meetinghouse (what we call our place of worship) is located at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/YShvAXQGwSL2">531 Raleigh Road, Chapel Hill, NC 27514</a>. It is located near the intersection with Country Club Drive
    near the UNC-CH campus. Raleigh Rd. is also Route 54. There is a UNC-CH
    visitors&apos; parking lot east of the Meetinghouse that is available for
    free parking on Sunday mornings. There are some parking spaces adjacent to
    the Meeting house in our parking lot. We are a two minute walk from the
    Institute of Government and from the old Chapel Hill Cemetery. There is a
    bus stop just west of the Meeting house on South Road across from the
    Institute of Government.</p>
