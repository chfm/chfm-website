# Celebration Committee Recommendations
Approved by Ministry and Worship, September, 2019

## Welcoming Babies/Children
Care and Counsel will invite families who have a new member (by birth or
adoption) to be welcomed into the meeting. Others who have been affiliated
with the meeting are invited to request a welcoming. The welcoming would
involve introducing the child to the community at MFW and giving them a
welcoming certificate for those in attendance to sign. Care and Counsel will
assign a point person to reach out to the parents and consult with them on the
wording and other components of the ceremony.

The welcoming should coincide with the monthly potluck meal when possible. Care and
Counsel will provide and bear the cost of a sheet cake and flowers. If the family wishes to host
a light reception on a different date, they are encouraged to coordinate it with help from
meeting volunteers as available.

## Graduation Recognition
Ministry and Worship and Adult Religious Education will invite high school and
undergraduate seniors in our meeting community to speak at a forum in late
spring about their formative years in CHFM. Others who are earning advanced
degrees will also be invited to participate. Meeting for Worship with
Attention to Graduation will follow the forum as well as the monthly potluck.
Ministry and Worship will assign a point person to reach out to graduates and
will provide and bear the cost of a sheet cake and gift book.

## Weddings
Weddings under the care of the meeting result from the time-honored practice
of clearness committees and are supported by the subsequent wedding
committee. Generally, all costs are borne by the wedding couple.

## Memorials
Care and Counsel and a representative from the Hospitality Committee will work
with the family on planning any reception following the memorial service if it
is held on the grounds of the meeting. Volunteers in the community may be
asked to provide drinks and light refreshments.

## Christmas Party
The annual Christmas party is a collaborative effort between the Hospitality
and Children and Youth Religious Education committees.

## Other Events

We welcome more celebrations which enrich our community. We are mindful that
these events require time and effort. Events such as the Spiritual State of
the Meeting, the New Yearâ€™s Eve celebration, anniversary or birthday parties,
etc. are the responsibility of the committee or individual who initiates
them. Hospitality has developed instructions for those using our
facilities. Please consult them prior to the event.
