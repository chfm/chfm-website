# Anecdotes from the AntiRacism Committee

These are short stories that illustrate racist OR anti-racist actions.  They should ideally be no longer than 100 words, but this is not an ironclad rule.

## Touching a Person’s Hair  

My friend, standing on the CHFM porch watched a White member of Meeting talking to a Black man from OCC as she touched his hair.  Telling me about it, her shame and her fierce response taught me it was wrong.  “How do we teach our Meeting to see how wrong it is to touch someone like permission is not required?” she asked without knowing the answer or even having hope that there was an answer.  I have never forgotten that conversation or her despair.

## Find Another Way

When I was in kindergarten, a White friend I had made on the school bus excitedly told me about her new guinea pig. I asked if I could come to her house to see it one day.  The next day, she informed me that I could not come over because her mother did not like Black people. She then avoided me on the bus.

I was hurt and after a few days, I told my mother about it.  She took me to a pet store to see and hold a guinea pig. I honestly did not like it much. It seemed too small and fragile and did not seem interested in playing with me. I thought it was boring. I eventually made other friends on the bus and forgot the girl's name.

What I learned that day was that sometimes what people will try to keep me away from is not all that great, but they simply like the power to discriminate. If I wanted the experience or object, I had to find another way to get it.

A White co-worker recently told me about the times she was surprised to find Confederate flags on her friends' beautiful boats here in lower Delaware. All I could think about is how glad I was that I was not invited and how much fun I have had on boats with other types of people.

## Slavery was a good system?

In 1981 my nine year old daughter was told by her teacher that slavery was a good system for many Black people.  When confronting the principal and teacher, I learned that the teacher had been saying this for thirty years to a 100% White audience.  

This was the first time her class in this northern NJ town had been integrated. The first time she had been exposed for her racist rhetoric.  The principal promised to put an end to her career if it ever happened again.

I wondered then and now, where are all those nine year olds from other classrooms, towns, and states who heard similar or worse? Are they Proud Boys now?

## Hiding with the White People

During the Capitol attack on 1/6/21, a Democrat thought he could foil the invaders by suggesting that his Democrat associates move with him over to the Republican side and blend in, to avoid the wrath of the rioters, who were after Democrats.  OOPS… When he saw the puzzled faces of his Black associates It occurred to him that THEY could not blend in.

 At his age, a member of the House of Representatives who had lived in the USA all his life, he had an embarrassing revelation.  He too was protected by the cloak of “White Privilege” and never even realized it, and all of its ramifications.
