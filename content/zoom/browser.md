# Zoom Workarounds

If you aren't able to install Zoom Client for Meetings on your computer, or
your computer lacks a built-in camera or microphone, there are several possible
workarounds:

* <a href="#browser">Run Zoom in a Browser</a>
* <a href="#webcam">Run Zoom with a Webcam</a>
* <a href="#headphones">Run Zoom with Headphones</a>
* <a href="#telephone">Zoom by Telephone</a>

## <a name="browser"></a>Run Zoom in a Browser
If you aren't able to install Zoom Client for Meetings on your computer,
you can still run Zoom in a browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc).

However, functionality varies with the browser&#8212;you might not see what
others see (works best in Chrome). Of course this assumes that your computer
has camera and microphone.

After clicking on the zoom link, click **Click here** to open
Zoom in your browser.

Alternatively, you can click **download &amp; run Zoom** to
first install Zoom on your computer. However, there will be a delay before
you can join the meeting, so you might want to run Zoom in your browser and
install it later.

## <a name="webcam"></a>Run Zoom with a Webcam
If your computer lacks both a camera and a microphone, purchasing a webcam
with microphone is ideal. But, expect slow delivery for new orders&#8212;webcams
seem to be in high demand online along with everything else.

## <a name="headphones"></a>Run Zoom with Headphones

If your computer doesn't have a microphone allowing you to speak, you can
use headphones or earbuds with an integrated mic.

**Note**: Older machines that have different input jacks for
audio and mic might require a splitter to provide for both jacks. Newer machines
with integrated audio will use a single input for both audio and mic (no splitter
required). Headphones with a USB connector also might work.

Headphones won&#8217;t allow others to see you, but you will be able to see
others and to speak. If your computer is on the floor, you will need to by
headphones with a long cord. Headphones with mic should be available for under
$25 at drugstores.

## <a name="telephone"></a>Zoom by Telephone

If you have a problem with your computer and don't have a smartphone, you can still participate in a zoom meeting on a telephone. Look for the number to call in the weekly eNews.

**Sample zoom by telephone:**

`You:` **`929-205-6099`** (or another number)<br />
`Zoom:` Welcome to zoom. Enter your meeting ID followed by #<br />
`You:` **`123 4567 8910#`**<br />
`Zoom:` Enter your participant ID followed by #. Otherwise just press # to continue<sup>*</sup>.<br />
`You:` **`#`**<br />
`Zoom:` Please enter the meeting password followed by #<br />
`You:` **`123456#`**<br />
`Zoom:` You are in the meeting now. There are 10 participants in the meeting.

<sup>*</sup>You have a participant ID only if you have already entered the meeting in another way (e.g., through a computer). If so, you can enter the particpant ID once you are in the meeting by entering **#Participant ID#** on your phone.

**Phone controls (use your phone's dial pad)**

> *6 - Toggle mute/unmute<br />
> *9 - Raise hand (**Note:** The notification to host is not very noticeable. Don't be offended if you are not recognized)

**Sample interaction:**

`You:` **`*6`**<br />
`Zoom:` You are muted. You can unmute yourself by pressing *6<br />
`You:` **`*6`**<br />
`Zoom:` You are unmuted<br />
`You:` **`*9`**<br />
`Zoom:` The host will be informed that you would like to speak.

**Notes:**
- Zoom invitations designate toll-free numbers by adding "(Toll Free)". If you do not see parentheses after the number, then it is likely a toll number
- If you dial a toll number, you will be charged based on the rates of your phone service provider. If you dial a number outside the US it is treated as a long distance call.
- Cell phone calls are generally free under most cell phone plans.
