# Zoom Workarounds

If you aren't able to install Zoom Client for Meetings on your computer, or
your computer lacks a built-in camera or microphone, there are several possible
workarounds:

* <a href="#browser">Run Zoom in a Browser</a>
* <a href="#webcam">Run Zoom with a Webcam</a>
* <a href="#headphones">Run Zoom with Headphones</a>

## <a name="browser"></a>Run Zoom in a Browser
If you aren't able to install Zoom Client for Meetings on your computer,
you can still run Zoom in a browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc).

However, functionality varies with the browser&#8212;you might not see what
others see (works best in Chrome). Of course this assumes that your computer
has camera and microphone.

After clicking on the zoom link, click **Click here** to open
Zoom in your browser.

Alternatively, you can click **download &amp; run Zoom** to
first install Zoom on your computer. However, there will be a delay before
you can join the meeting, so you might want to run Zoom in your browser and
install it later.

## <a name="webcam"></a>Run Zoom with a Webcam
If your computer lacks both a camera and a microphone, purchasing a webcam
with microphone is ideal. But, expect slow delivery for new orders&#8212;webcams
seem to be in high demand online along with everything else.

## <a name="headphones"></a>Run Zoom with Headphones

If your computer doesn't have a microphone allowing you to speak, you can
use headphones or earbuds with an integrated mic.

**Note**: Older machines that have different input jacks for
audio and mic might require a splitter to provide for both jacks. Newer machines
with integrated audio will use a single input for both audio and mic (no splitter
required). Headphones with a USB connector also might work.

Headphones won&#8217;t allow others to see you, but you will be able to see
others and to speak. If your computer is on the floor, you will need to by
headphones with a long cord. Headphones with mic should be available for under
$25 at drugstores.
