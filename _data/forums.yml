    Guest speaker: Mary Rider, founding-member of the Fr. Charles Mulholland
    Catholic Worker House in Garner, NC, and life-long advocate for peace.
    Mary’s husband Patrick O’Neill is currently serving a federal prison
    sentence for his acts of civil disobedience at the Kings Bay Naval
    Submarine Base in Georgia on April 4th, 2018, the 50th anniversary of
    the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. The "Kings Bay 7" were
    attempting to make real the prophet Isiah’s command to “beat swords into
    plowshares.” Mary will share about a lifetime of peace activism and what
    Patrick is facing in prison during Covid-times.

     We’ll reflect on some passages from Faith and Practice, hear from a panel
     about how they live this testimony, and share in small groups and together.
