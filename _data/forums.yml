    Complicating Legacies: Slavery, Equity, & Inclusion on a Southern
    Quaker Campus
  description: |
    Guilford College's Associate Vice President of Diversity, Equity, and
    Inclusion, Krishauna Hines-Gaither; and Quaker Librarian and Archivist,
    Gwen Gosney Erickson; complicate the dominant Quaker narrative as it
    relates to slavery and anti-slavery with specific focus on our own local
    history. Their work reevaluates dominant narratives to center the African
    American experience and sheds light on the fact that Quakers are
    historically as divided on issues of slavery, racial equity, and inclusion
    as other predominantly white groups.
