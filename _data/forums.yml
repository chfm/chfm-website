    the 1940s and 1950s, of the handful of people who started the CHFM, which
    led to the development of the IFC (Interfaith Food Council) and Quaker
    House. Attending Friends who knew these people are invited to participate
    in the discussion.

  title: Worship Sharing with Attention to Animals
  description: |
    Animals enrich our lives â€“ as part of nature, as pets, as
    helpers, as research subjects, as food. We will share concern for the
    welfare of all animals. Feel free to bring photos or well-mannered animals.
    See the newsletter, website or contact Robin Harper for guidelines, more
    information, or to arrange for pet sitting afterwards.
