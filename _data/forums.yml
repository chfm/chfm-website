    Finding the Inner Light in Challenging Times
  description: |
    We will watch the Quakerspeak video, "Quakers and the Inner Light," and
    break into small groups to discuss how we have found and shared light in
    the current situation.


    The forum will use Zoom audio and video conferencing. To join the forum,
    click on this link, which will be the same link as for Meeting for Worship.
