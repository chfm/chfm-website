  content: |
    The following queries may be considered by the applicant for membership and
    his or her clearness committee as background for their discussions. They
    relate to aspects of belief and practice that exemplify the common ground
    of the Chapel Hill Friends Meeting and the Religious Society of Friends as
    a whole. Nevertheless, there are wide variations in interpretation and
    expression of these matters among individual Friends

    - What does the phrase "there is that of God in everyone" mean to you? How
      does this find expression in your life and in your relationships with
      other people?
    - Where are you now in your spiritual journey? What are you seeking? What
      are you leaving behind? How do you relate to other current or former
      religious affiliations?
    - Are you comfortable with the thought of relying on the Inward Light as a
      guide on your spiritual journey, finding continual revelation within
      rather than relying on external authority? Do you find the collective
      experience and insights of Friends helpful in reaching your own
      understandings?
    - Do the teachings of Jesus and traditional Christian views of Jesus have a
      place in your religious life? Are you comfortable with the wide range of
      views in this regard among Friends?
    - Do you find the emphasis on the living silence in Friends worship helpful
      to your religious life? Do you find the messages in the spoken ministry of
      Friends helpful to you?
    - Do you understand the distinction between a programmed and an
      unprogrammed Friends meeting? Are you comfortable with the view that all
      participants in the Meeting are ministers who, through their words or
      actions, serve the spiritual needs of one another?
    - How does your family feel about your seeking membership in Friends
      Meeting? Does this present any problems for you?
    - Are you familiar with the testimonies of Friends, and to what extent do
      you try to exemplify them in your life?
      - The testimony of simplicity
      - The testimony of peace or non-violence
      - The testimony of integrity
      - The testimony of community
      - The testimony of equality
    - Does the idea of integrating your inner spiritual life to the outer world
      of your everyday life appeal to you? Does prayer or meditation play a
      part in joining inner and outer?
    - What does it mean that Friends Meetings for Business are conducted in a
      spirit of worship, and that decisions are reached by active search for
      unity?
    - What contributions and talents do you feel you can bring the Meeting
      community through membership? What gifts might you receive from others?
    - How would you characterize a vital Meeting? What responsibilities do you
      feel the Meeting has towards its children? What are the greatest
      strengths and weaknesses of the Society of Friends as it faces the future?
    - What are your interests in the wider family of Friends as represented
      by such organizations as Piedmont Friends Fellowship, Piedmont Friends
      Yearly Meeting, Friends General Conference, American Friends Service
      Committee, Friends World Committee for Consultation, Friends Committee on
      National Legislation, Quaker House, Carolina Friends School and the like?
    - Are you familiar with Quaker publications such as the Friends Journal,
      Pendle Hill Pamphlet Series, etc.? Are you aware of the Meeting's
      own resources (e.g., the library, various funds, clearness committees,
      adult and children's religious education programs)?
    - What are your expectations of membership in the Meeting? How can the
      Meeting facilitate your integration into its membership?
    - What reservations, doubts, or unanswered questions do you have
      concerning membership in a Friends Meeting?

    A person who feels ready to become a member of the Chapel Hill Friends
    Meeting begins by writing a letter or email, which may be brief, stating
    the reasons for feeling drawn to take this step. The letter or email is
    addressed to the Clerk, who, with the consent of the writer, may read the
    text of the message at the next Monthly Meeting for Worship with Attention
    to Business. If the Clerk does not read the letter in full, the request
    for a clearness committee for membership will be presented and then the
    Clerk will refer it to the Committee on Ministry and Worship. Ministry and
    Worship will in turn appoint a clearness committee for membership. The
    committee will be composed of four or more members of the Meeting, at
    least two of whom are members of Ministry and Worship and one of whom is a
    member of Care and Counsel. The person requesting membership may also
    choose an additional Friend, who is a member of the meeting, to serve on
    the clearness committee. Prior to the meeting of the first clearness
    committee, the convener will provide a copy of Philadelphia Yearly Meeting's
    _Faith and Practice_ and Chapel Hill Friends Meeting's _Suggestions for
    Participation in Meeting for Worship_ to the person requesting membership.

    Members of the clearness committee usually meet once without the applicant
    to clarify with one another their perceptions of clearness, the meaning of
    membership, and any concerns they might want to pursue in some depth. This
    is sometimes done just prior to the first meeting with the person requesting
    membership.

    It is recommended that the clearness committee will meet two or more times
    with the person requesting membership to explore the meaning of membership,
    the commitments involved, and any other issues that may seem relevant. The
    number of meetings varies according to the needs, interests, and range of
    matters that the seeker and members of the committee wish to consider.
    Matters that may be considered are indicated in Section A above.

    The clearness committee may benefit by having one or more meetings without
    the applicant present to reflect with one another, share possible
    reservations and consider any further meetings with the person requesting
    membership.

    When clearness is found, the clearness committee brings the matter to the
    Committee on Ministry and Worship. If Ministry and Worship concurs, the
    clerk of Ministry and Worship or the convener of the Clearness Committee
    will take the matter to Business Meeting, presenting the request, as well as
    its own written recommendation.

    Should clearness not be reached, the person requesting membership is
    encouraged to explore the unresolved issues alone, with the help from the
    clearness committee or other Meeting and non-Meeting resources.

    Upon approval for membership by the Business Meeting, a welcoming committee
    will be formed from the Meeting at large to welcome and become better
    acquainted with the new member.

    The convener of the clearness committee is responsible for presenting a
    short biography of the new member for publication in the newsletter and
    introducing him or her to the next convenient Meeting for Worship. The Clerk
    of Ministry and Worship is responsible for ensuring that tokens of
    acceptance/recognition (e.g., subscription to Friends Journal) are presented
    to the new member.

    Members of both the clearness and welcoming committees generally have a
    continuing responsibility for keeping in touch with the new member,
    reflecting the Meeting"s ongoing concern for his or her welfare.

    To assist in the flourishing of Quakerism in the world, it is our conviction
    that we have a responsibility to provide a religious home to children of our
    members and attenders where the growth of one's spiritual journey and the
    values of simplicity, peace, integrity, community, and equality can be nurtured.
    Furthermore, it is our belief that these children rightfully possess this
    valuable heritage which they will take with them as they make their own
    decisions about their spiritual journey.

    **Young children.** Our children are blessings that enrich and shape our
    Meeting, and we want them to experience being full participants in the
    fellowship of the Meeting. To this end we invite the children of Meeting members
    to be enrolled as familial members. Becoming a familial member may be initiated
    in several ways. Ministry and Worship may initiate familial membership for a
    newborn to a Meeting family or for children moving into our Meeting community. A
    Meeting family can also initiate the process by making a specific request to
    Ministry and Worship regarding familial membership. It may also be that a family
    will request Membership into the Meeting for themselves and their children at
    the same time. Once initiated, familial membership is accomplished with the
    consent of parents; is brought forward by Ministry and Worship, and acted upon
    by the Meeting for Worship with Attention to Business. As children age and
    eventually leave home, familial membership converts either to full membership or
    to affiliated membership as described below.

    **High school aged children.** The Ministry and Worship Committee, in
    collaboration with the Children's and Youth Religious Education Committee,
    will provide opportunities for youth in our high school program to learn about
    what it means to be a full adult member, attender, or affiliated member of the
    Chapel Hill Friends Meeting, and what paths lead to each status.

    **Familial members or Youth First Day school attenders choosing to become a
    **member of the Chapel Hill Friends Meeting.** Becoming a full member of
    CHFM can take place during the high
    school years or later if the familial member or youth attender is so led.
    High school aged children who want to pursue this step, are invited to
    write or email the meeting clerk (<a href="mailto:clerkofmeeting@chapelhillfriends.org">clerkofmeeting@chapelhillfriends.org</a>).
    This step will start a clearness process, identical to that described earlier.

    **Familial members choosing not to become members of the Chapel Hill Friends
    Meeting.** Familial members who choose not to become members of CHFM during
    their high school years, will become affiliated members at the age of 18
    through the age of 30. They will remain in the meeting directory until age
    25 and then from age 25-30 if they provide current contact information when
    contacted annually.

    **Non-familial youth attenders** may request membership or affiliated
    status with the CHFM any time during High School. Affilitated status will be
    granted at the age of 18 and last through the age of 30. They will remain in the
    meeting directory until age 25 and then from age 25-30 if they provide current
    contact information when contacted annually.

    **All young adults.** We encourage young adults who are convinced by the
    testimonies of Friends to seek membership in the Religious Society of Friends.
    Whatever decisions young adults make, all should know that their spiritual home
    at the Chapel Hill Friends Meeting always remains available to them.

    Members of the Monthly Meeting who move to other communities may continue as
    non-resident members of the Meeting. They may request a letter of
    introduction to the Meeting nearest their new residence and to individual
    Friends in that area known to our Meeting. Such letters recommend them to
    local Friends but do not affect membership in our Meeting.

    Friends residing temporarily at a distance from their Meeting but not
    wishing to transfer membership may request of their home Meeting a minute
    addressed to the visited Meeting asking for sojourner status.

    Sojourning members have all the privileges and responsibilities of regular
    members, including the right to participate in decisions of the Meeting,
    serve on committees, and convene those committees. However, rather than long
    term sojourning, a transfer of membership is suggested to facilitate
    integration into the new Meeting.

- name: Transfer to Friends Elsewhere

    A member who would like to transfer membership to another Meeting
    should write the Clerk asking for a Letter of Transfer. The Clerk will
    refer the matter to the Committee on Ministry and Worship for such
    investigation as may be appropriate to fulfill our responsibility to the
    other Meeting. When the M&W Committee is satisfied, the committee clerk
    will ask the Corresponding Clerk to prepare an appropriate Letter of
    Transfer recommending our member to the other Meeting. After the Letter
    is approved by the Meeting for Business, the Corresponding Clerk will
    send the original to the receiving Meeting and a copy to the
    transferring member. After we are notified of acceptance of the
    transfer, the member's name is removed from our membership roll.

- name: Transfer from Friends Elsewhere
  tag: "transfer-from"

    The Clerk should acknowledge receipt of the Letter of Transfer from another
    Meeting and bring the matter to the next Meeting for Business. Upon
    approval, the transfer will be reflected in the minutes and a welcoming
    committee chosen to introduce the new member into fellowship and acquaint
    him or her with the local Meeting activities.

    The Recorder will add the new member's name to the membership rolls and
    obtain the appropriate information for the Meeting records. The
    corresponding clerk will write letters a) to inform the issuing meeting that
    CHFM has accepted the transfer of membership and b) to welcome the
    transferring member.

- name: Resignation
  tag: "resignation"
  content: |
    A Friend may wish to be released from membership as part of joining another
    denomination. A letter requesting resignation should be addressed to the
    Clerk. When approved, the Corresponding Clerk will write a letter of
    recommendation to the new organization. A member who is not in basic accord
    with the ideals and practices of Friends is encouraged to seek the advice of
    Care and Counsel or of trusted others and try, with their help, to examine
    personal beliefs and practices in the light of Friends' testimonies and
    beliefs. If continued membership is not desired, resignation of membership
    should be presented in writing to the Monthly Meeting. Upon approval, the
    Corresponding Clerk should inform the person in writing of his or her
    release and mention the possibility of re-applying.

- name: Release from Membership
  tag: "release-from-membership"
  content: |
    Occasionally a member may seriously disregard the obligations of membership,
    exhibit a lack of interest or responsibility in the Meeting or lose all
    contact with the Meeting. In such cases, it is the responsibility of the
    Care and Counsel Committee to attempt to re-establish contact and interest.
    If continued efforts over an adequate period (at least one year) are
    unsuccessful, the Care and Counsel and Ministry and Worship committees may
    jointly recommend to the Monthly Meeting a minute explaining the
    circumstances and recording reluctant removal of the individual from
    membership. Whenever possible, the Corresponding Clerk will send that a
    written notice of this action to the person removed.

    From time to time, the behavior of a particular Friend may appear to disrupt
    the Meeting life or be out of keeping with Friends' traditional practice. In
    such situations, the Ministry and Worship and Care and Counsel committees
    will seek a loving and thoughtful solution. In the end, involuntary release
    from membership can only be accomplished by the Monthly Meeting for
    Business.
