- name: Adult Religious Education
  email: are
  description: The Adult Religious Education committee nurtures the spiritual growth of the adults in the Meeting by developing programs, workshops, classes, retreats, and other activities that address their spiritual needs. One of the main functions of this committee is the planning and implementation of weekly Forums, between early and late meetings. When a committee, group, or individual wishes to present a forum ARE asks for an outline of the presentation that illuminates what aspects of Quaker faith and practice will come forth at the forum. This often involves some reference to what spiritual leanings arose to direct the work the presenter is involved in and how this manifests in daily life. The forum outline would also make clear how participants will be able to engage in active dialogue with each other and/or the presenters. Finally giving forums a title that captures its essence is very helpful. Having these elements in place guides ARE in ensuring that the experience participants have at forums will be rich and meaningful.
