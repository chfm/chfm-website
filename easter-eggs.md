Okay so in the anticipation that some of my _character_ might be considered "unprofessional" or "blasphemous," I have helpfully compiled a list of all of the easter eggs I have included on the unfortunate day that they must be removed. Since I have already added a bunch before writing this, I cannot guarantee that this list is exhaustive. But it probably is.

1. If you click my name in the footer, credits appear
2. some of the 'slogans' are a bit snarky, although none would be actually offensive as best I can figure
3. in the "what do quakers mean when they say... section of the about page, I included a helpful tip to not bother reading it. This may be considered not acceptable, but honestly, try reading that section! oof.
4. A lot of the code comments are written using casual language. But no one checks those, right?
