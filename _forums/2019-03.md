## _Mar 3_ - TALKING ABOUT WHAT NO ONE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT

What to do when shots are firedâ€¦ or when some other emergency happens...in the
Meetinghouse...or wherever you happen to be. We'll share recommendations from
local fire, police, our own months-long research, and responses from each of you
as we discern our next steps. Facilitated by Matt Drake, John Hite and Jan
Hutton. Moderator: Carolyn White
